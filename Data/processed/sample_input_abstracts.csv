Jisun AN,"We present a preliminary but groundbreaking study of the media landscape of Twitter. We use public data on whom follows who to uncover common behaviour in media consumption, the relationship between various classes of media, and the diversity of media content which social links may bring. Our analysis shows that there is a non-negligible amount of indirect media exposure, either through friends who follow particular media sources, or via retweeted messages. We show that the indirect media exposure expands the political diversity of news to which users are exposed to a surprising extent, increasing the range by between 60-98%. These results are valuable because they have not been readily available to traditional media, and they can help predict how we will read news, and how publishers will interact with us in the future."
Jisun AN,"A growing number of people are changing the way they consume news, replacing the traditional physical newspapers and magazines by their virtual online versions or/and weblogs. The interactivity and immediacy present in online news are changing the way news are being produced and exposed by media corporations. News websites have to create effective strategies to catch people’s attention and attract their clicks. In this paper we investigate possible strategies used by online news corporations in the design of their news headlines. We analyze the content of 69,907 headlines produced by four major global media corporations during a minimum of eight consecutive months in 2014. In order to discover strategies that could be used to attract clicks, we extracted features from the text of the news headlines related to the sentiment polarity of the headline. We discovered that the sentiment of the headline is strongly related to the popularity of the news and also with the dynamics of the posted comments on that particular news."
Jisun AN,"To bring their innovative ideas to market, those embarking in new ventures have to raise money, and, to do so, they have often resorted to banks and venture capitalists. Nowadays, they have an additional option: that of crowdfunding. The name refers to the idea that funds come from a network of people on the Internet who are passionate about supporting others' projects. One of the most popular crowdfunding sites is Kickstarter. In it, creators post descriptions of their projects and advertise them on social media sites (mainly Twitter), while investors look for projects to support. The most common reason for project failure is the inability of founders to connect with a sufficient number of investors, and that is mainly because hitherto there has not been any automatic way of matching creators and investors. We thus set out to propose different ways of recommending investors found on Twitter for specific Kickstarter projects …"
Jisun AN,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was exported to Korea in 2015, resulting in a threat to neighboring nations. We evaluated the possibility of using a digital surveillance system based on web searches and social media data to monitor this MERS outbreak. We collected the number of daily laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and quarantined cases from May 11, 2015 to June 26, 2015 using the Korean government MERS portal. The daily trends observed via Google search and Twitter during the same time period were also ascertained using Google Trends and Topsy. Correlations among the data were then examined using Spearman correlation analysis. We found high correlations (> 0.7) between Google search and Twitter results and the number of confirmed MERS cases for the previous three days using only four simple keywords:“MERS”,“”(“MERS (in Korean)”),“”(“MERS symptoms …"
Jisun AN,"We propose a novel approach for isolating customer segments using online customer data for products that are distributed via online social media platforms. We use non-negative matrix factorization to first identify behavioral customer segments and then to identify demographic customer segments. We employ a methodology for linking the two segments to present integrated and holistic customer segments, also known as personas. Behavioral segments are generated from customer interactions with online content. Demographic segments are generated using the gender, age, and location of these customers. In addition to evaluating our approach, we demonstrate its practicality via a system leveraging these customer segments to automatically generate personas, which are fictional but accurate representations of each integrated behavioral and demographic segment. Results show that this approach can …"
Jisun AN,"Online social media platforms generally attempt to mitigate hateful expressions, as these comments can be detrimental to the health of the community. However, automatically identifying hateful comments can be challenging. We manually label 5,143 hateful expressions posted to YouTube and Facebook videos among a dataset of 137,098 comments from an online news media. We then create a granular taxonomy of different types and targets of online hate and train machine learning models to automatically detect and classify the hateful comments in the full dataset. Our contribution is twofold: 1) creating a granular taxonomy for hateful online comments that includes both types and targets of hateful comments, and 2) experimenting with machine learning, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, and Linear SVM, to generate a multiclass, multilabel classification model that automatically detects and categorizes hateful comments in the context of online news media. We find that the best performing model is Linear SVM, with an average F1 score of 0.79 using TF-IDF features. We validate the model by testing its predictive ability, and, relatedly, provide insights on distinct types of hate speech taking place on social media."
Jisun AN,"We develop a methodology for persona generation using real time social media data for the distribution of products via online platforms. From a large social media account containing more than 30 million interactions from users from 181 countries engaging with more than 4,200 digital products produced by a global media corporation, we demonstrate that our methodology can first identify both distinct and impactful user segments and then create persona descriptions by automatically adding pertinent features, such as names, photos, and personal attributes. We validate our approach by implementing the methodology into an actual working system that leverages large scale online user data for generation of persona descriptions. We present the overall methodological approach, data analysis process, and system development. Findings show this method can develop believable personas representing real groups …"
Jisun AN,"The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people seek out information that supports their views and eschew information that conflicts with their beliefs, and that has negative consequences on our society. Few researchers have recently found counter evidence of selective exposure in social media: users are exposed to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what happens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure, though. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the partisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid conflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (eg, depending on their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (eg, around elections); and 4) changes …"
Jisun AN,"Traditional media outlets are known to report political news in a biased way, potentially affecting the political beliefs of the audience and even altering their voting behaviors. Therefore, tracking bias in everyday news and building a platform where people can receive balanced news information is important. We propose a model that maps the news media sources along a dimensional dichotomous political spectrum using the co-subscriptions relationships inferred by Twitter links. By analyzing 7 million follow links, we show that the political dichotomy naturally arises on Twitter when we only consider direct media subscription. Furthermore, we demonstrate a real-time Twitter-based application that visualizes an ideological map of various media sources."
Jisun AN,"One might think that, compared to traditional media, social media sites allow people to choose more freely what to read and what to share, especially for politically oriented news. However, reading and sharing habits originate from deeply ingrained behaviors that might be hard to change. To test the extent to which this is true, we propose a Political News Sharing (PoNS) model that holistically captures four key aspects of social psychology: gratification, selective exposure, socialization, and trust & intimacy. Using real instances of political news sharing in Twitter, we study the predictive power of these features. As one might expect, news sharing heavily depends on what one likes and agrees with (selective exposure). Interestingly, it also depends on the credibility of a news source, i.e., whether the source is a social media friend or a news outlet (trust & intimacy) as well as on the informativeness or the …"
Jisun AN,"We develop a methodology to automate creating imaginary people, referred to as personas, by processing complex behavioral and demographic data of social media audiences. From a popular social media account containing more than 30 million interactions by viewers from 198 countries engaging with more than 4,200 online videos produced by a global media corporation, we demonstrate that our methodology has several novel accomplishments, including: (a) identifying distinct user behavioral segments based on the user content consumption patterns; (b) identifying impactful demographics groupings; and (c) creating rich persona descriptions by automatically adding pertinent attributes, such as names, photos, and personal characteristics. We validate our approach by implementing the methodology into an actual working system; we then evaluate it via quantitative methods by examining the accuracy of …"
Jisun AN,"Demographics, in particular, gender, age, and race, are a key predictor of human behavior. Despite the significant effect that demographics plays, most scientific studies using online social media do not consider this factor, mainly due to the lack of such information. In this work, we use state-of-the-art face analysis software to infer gender, age, and race from profile images of 350K Twitter users from New York. For the period from November 1, 2014 to October 31, 2015, we study which hashtags are used by different demographic groups. Though we find considerable overlap for the most popular hashtags, there are also many group-specific hashtags."
Jisun AN,"The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people crave like-minded information and eschew information that conflicts with their beliefs, and that has negative consequences on political life. Yet, despite decades of research, this hypothesis remains theoretically promising but empirically difficult to test. We look into news articles shared on Facebook and examine whether selective exposure exists or not in social media. We find a concrete evidence for a tendency that users predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid conflicting ones, and partisans are more likely to do that. Building tools to counter partisanship on social media would require the ability to identify partisan users first. We will show that those users cannot be distinguished from the average user as the two subgroups do not show any demographic difference."
Jisun AN,"Contemporary media systems are in transition. The constellation of organizations, groups, and individuals contributing information to national and international news flows has changed as a result of the digital transformation. The “hybrid media system” has proven to be one of the most instructive concepts addressing this change. Its focus on the mutually dependent interconnections between various types of media organizations, actors, and publics has inspired prolific research. Yet the concept can tempt researchers to sidestep systematic analyses of information flows and actors’ differing degrees of influence by treating media systems as a black box. To enable large-scale, empirical comparative studies aimed at identifying interdependencies and power relationships in contemporary media systems, we propose the concept of discursive power. This describes the ability of contributors to communication spaces to …"
Jisun AN,"In this work, we reveal the structure of global news coverage of disasters and its determinants by using a large-scale news coverage dataset collected by the GDELT (Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone) project that monitors news media in over 100 languages from the whole world. Significant variables in our hierarchical (mixed-effect) regression model, such as population, political stability, damage, and more, are well aligned with a series of previous research. However, we find strong regionalism in news geography, highlighting the necessity of comprehensive datasets for the study of global news coverage."
Jisun AN,"In this research, we conceptually examine the use of personas in an age of large-scale online analytics data. Based on the criticism and benefits outlined in prior work and by practitioners working with online data, we formulate the major arguments for and against the use of personas given real-time online analytics data about customers, analyze these arguments, and demonstrate areas for the productive employment of data-driven personas by leveraging online analytics data in their creation. Our key tenet is that data-driven personas are located between aggregated and individual customer statistics. At their best, digital data-driven personas capture the coverage of the customer base attributed to aggregated data representations while retaining the interpretability of individual-level analytics; they benefit from powerful computational techniques and novel data sources. We discuss how digital data-driven personas can draw from technological advancements to remedy the notable concerns voiced by scholars and practitioners, including persona validation, inconsistency problem, and long development times. Finally, we outline areas of future research of personas in the context of online analytics. We argue that to survive in the rapidly developing online customer analytics industry, personas must evolve by adopting new practices."
Jisun AN,"In this research, we investigate if and how more photos than a single headshot can heighten the level of information provided by persona profiles. We conduct eye-tracking experiments and qualitative interviews with variations in the photos: a single headshot, a headshot and images of the persona in different contexts, and a headshot with pictures of different people representing key persona attributes. The results show that more contextual photos significantly improve the information end users derive from a persona profile; however, showing images of different people creates confusion and lowers the informativeness. Moreover, we discover that choice of pictures results in various interpretations of the persona that are biased by the end users' experiences and preconceptions. The results imply that persona creators should consider the design power of photos when creating persona profiles."
Jisun AN,"In this research, we evaluate four widely used face detection tools, which are Face++, IBM Bluemix Visual Recognition, AWS Rekognition, and Microsoft Azure Face API, using multiple datasets to determine their accuracy in inferring user attributes, including gender, race, and age. Results show that the tools are generally proficient at determining gender, with accuracy rates greater than 90%, except for IBM Bluemix. Concerning race, only one of the four tools provides this capability, Face++, with an accuracy rate of greater than 90%, although the evaluation was performed on a high-quality dataset. Inferring age appears to be a challenging problem, as all four tools performed poorly. The findings of our quantitative evaluation are helpful for future computational social science research using these tools, as their accuracy needs to be taken into account when applied to classifying individuals on social media and other contexts. Triangulation and manual verification are suggested for researchers employing these tools."
Jisun AN,"Online platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, provide users with a rich set of features for sharing and consuming political information, expressing political opinions, and exchanging potentially contrary political views. In such activities, two types of communication spaces naturally emerge: those dominated by exchanges between politically homogeneous users and those that allow and encourage crosscutting exchanges in politically heterogeneous groups. While research on political talk in online environments abounds, we know surprisingly little about the potentially varying nature of discussions in politically homogeneous spaces as compared to cross-cutting communication spaces. To fill this gap, we use Reddit to explore the nature of political discussions in homogeneous and cross-cutting communication spaces. In particular, we develop an analytical template to study interaction and linguistic patterns within and between politically homogeneous and heterogeneous communication spaces. Our analyses reveal different behavioral patterns in homogeneous and cross-cutting communications spaces. We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the context of research on political talk online."
Jisun AN,"Microblogging platforms are Web 2.0 services that represent a suitable environment for studying how information is propagated in social networks and how users can become influential. In this work we analyse the impact of the network features and of the users’ behaviour on the information diffusion. Our analysis highlights a strong relation between the level of visibility of a message in the flow of information seen by a user and the probability that the user further disseminates the message. In addition, we also highlight the existence of other latent factors that impact on the dissemination probability, correlated with the properties of the user that generated the message. Considering these results we define an information propagation model that generates information cascades (i.e. flows of messages propagated from user to user) whose statistical properties match empirical observations."
Jisun AN,"We study the response to the Charlie Hebdo shootings of January 7, 2015 on Twitter across the globe. We ask whether the stances on the issue of freedom of speech can be modeled using established sociological theories, including Huntington's culturalist Clash of Civilizations, and those taking into consideration social context, including Density and Interdependence theories. We find support for Huntington's culturalist explanation, in that the established traditions and norms of one's"" civilization"" predetermine some of one's opinion. However, at an individual level, we also find social context to play a significant role, with non-Arabs living in Arab countries using# JeSuisAhmed ("" I am Ahmed"") five times more often when they are embedded in a mixed Arab/non-Arab (mention) network. Among Arabs living in the West, we find a great variety of responses, not altogether associated with the size of their expatriate community, suggesting other variables to be at play."
Jisun AN,"Understanding users in the era of social media is challenging, requiring organizations to adopt novel computation-aided approaches. To exemplify such an approach, we retrieved information on millions of interactions with YouTube video content from a major Middle Eastern media outlet, to automatically generate personas that capture how different audience segments interact with thousands of individual content pieces. Then, we used qualitative data to provide additional insights into the automatically generated persona profiles. Our findings provide insights into social media usage in the Middle East and demonstrate the application of a novel methodology that generates culturally adapted personas of social media audiences, summarizing complex social analytics data into human portrayals that are easy to understand by end users in real organizations."
Jisun AN,"We propose a novel method for generating personas based on online user data for the increasingly common situation of content creators distributing products via online platforms. We use non-negative matrix factorization to identify user segments and develop personas by adding personality such as names and photos. Our approach can develop accurate personas representing real groups of people using online user data, versus relying on manually gathered data."
Jisun AN,"The use of personas is an interactive design technique with considerable potential for product and content development. However, personas have typically been viewed as fairly static. In this research, we implement an approach for creating personas in real time, based on automated analysis of actual social media data, integrating data from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube channels for a large commercial organization. From Twitter, we gather user insights representing interests and viewpoints, leveraging approximately 195,000 follower profiles. From YouTube, we gather demographic data and topical interests, leveraging more than 188,000 subscriber profiles and millions of user interactions. From Facebook, we collect instances of hundreds of thousands of link sharing by more than 54,000 social media followers, specifically examining the domains these users share. We integrate the social media data from all …"
Jisun AN,"We evaluate the effects of the topics of social media posts on audiences across five social media platforms (ie, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit) at four levels of user engagement. We collected 3,163,373 social posts from 53 news organizations across five platforms during an 8month period. We analyzed the differences in news organization platform strategies by focusing on topic variations by organization and the corresponding effect on user engagement at four levels. Findings show that topic distribution varies by platform, although there are some topics that are popular across most platforms. User engagement levels vary both by topics and platforms. Finally, we show that one can predict if an article will be publicly shared to another platform by individuals with precision of approximately 80%. This research has implications for news organizations desiring to increase and to prioritize types of user engagement."
Jisun AN,"We develop and implement an approach for automating generating personas in real time using actual YouTube social media data from a global media corporation. From the organization's YouTube channel, we gather demographic data, customer interactions, and topical interests, leveraging more than 188,000 subscriber profiles and more than 30 million user interactions. We demonstrate that online user data can be used to develop personas in real time using social media analytics. To get diverse aspects of personas, we collect user data from other social media channels as well and match them with the corresponding user data to generate richer personas. Our results provide corporate insights into competitive marketing, topical interests, and preferred product features for the users of the online news medium. Research implications are that reasonably rich personas can be generated in real time, instead of being the result of a laborious and time-consuming manual development process."
Jisun AN,"Because word semantics can substantially change across communities and contexts, capturing domain-specific word semantics is an important challenge. Here, we propose SEMAXIS, a simple yet powerful framework to characterize word semantics using many semantic axes in word- vector spaces beyond sentiment. We demonstrate that SEMAXIS can capture nuanced semantic representations in multiple online communities. We also show that, when the sentiment axis is examined, SEMAXIS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in building domain-specific sentiment lexicons."
Jisun AN,"We conduct a mixed-method study to better understand the content consumption patterns of Middle Eastern social media users and to explore new ways to present online data by using automatic persona generation. First, we analyze millions of content interactions on YouTube to dynamically generate personas describing behavioral patterns of different demographic groups. Second, we analyze interview data on social media users in the Middle Eastern region to generate additional insights into the dynamically generated personas. Our findings provide insights into social media users in the Middle East, as well as present a novel methodology of using computational analysis and qualitative data enrichment to generate descriptive and culturally receptive personas from social media audiences."
Jisun AN,"We investigate whether additional photos beyond a single headshot makes a persona profile more informative without confusing the end user. We conduct an eye-tracking experiment and qualitative interviews with digital content creators after varying the persona in photos via a single headshot, a headshot and photo of the persona in different contexts, and a headshot with photos of different people with key persona attributes the gender and age. Findings show that contextual photos provide significantly more persona information to end users; however, showing photos of multiple people engenders confusion and lowers informativeness. Also, as anticipated, viewing additional photos requires more cognitive focus, which is measured by eye-tracking metrics; these metrics are correlated with levels of informativeness and confusion. Furthermore, various interpretations of the persona based on the choice of photos …"
Jisun AN,"Personas are widely used in software development, system design, and HCI studies. Yet, their evaluation is difficult, and there are no recognized and validated measurement scales to date. To improve this condition, this research develops a persona perception scale based on reviewing relevant literature. We validate the scale through a pilot study with 19 participants, each evaluating three personas (57 evaluations in total). This is the first reported effort to systematically develop and validate an instrument for persona perception measurement. We find the constructs and items of the scale perform well, with factor loadings ranging between 0.60 and 0.95. Reliability, measured as Cronbach's Alpha, is also satisfactory, encouraging us to pursue the use of the scale with a larger sample in future work."
Jisun AN,"The widespread adoption and dissemination of online news through social media systems have been revolutionizing many segments of our society and ultimately our daily lives. In these systems, users can play a central role as they share content to their friends. Despite that, little is known about news spreaders in social media. In this paper, we provide the first of its kind in-depth characterization of news spreaders in social media. In particular, we investigate their demographics, what kind of content they share, and the audience they reach. Among our main findings, we show that males and white users tend to be more active in terms of sharing news, biasing the news audience to the interests of these demographic groups. Our results also quantify differences in interests of news sharing across demographics, which has implications for personalized news digests."
Jisun AN,"We present Automatic Persona Generation (APG), a methodology and system for quantitative persona generation using large amounts of online social media data. The system is operational, beta deployed with several client organizations in multiple industry verticals and ranging from small-to-medium sized enterprises to large multi-national corporations. Using a robust web framework and stable back-end database, APG is currently processing tens of millions of user interactions with thousands of online digital products on multiple social media platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube. APG identifies both distinct and impactful user segments and then creates persona descriptions by automatically adding pertinent features, such as names, photos, and personal attributes. We present the overall methodological approach, architecture development, and main system features. APG has a potential value for …"
Jisun AN,"In this work, we compare GDELT and Event Registry, which monitor news articles worldwide and provide big data to researchers regarding scale, news sources, and news geography.

Jisun AN,"Fact checking has been hard enough to do in traditional settings, but, as news consumption is moving on the Internet and sources multiply, it is almost unmanageable. To solve this problem, researchers have created applications that expose people to diverse opinions and, as a result, expose them to balanced information. The wisdom of this solution is, however, placed in doubt by this paper. Survey responses of 60 individuals in the UK and South Korea and in-depth structured interviews of 10 respondents suggest that exposure to diverse opinions would not always work. That is partly because not all individuals equally value opinion diversity, and mainly because the same individual benefits from it only at times. We find that whether one looks for diverse opinions largely depends on three factors--one's prior convictions, emotional state, and social context."
Jisun AN,"As the quantity of social and online analytics data has drastically increased, a wide variety of methods are deployed to make sense of this data, typically via computational and algorithmic approaches. However, in many cases, these approaches trade one form of complexity for another by ignoring the principles of human cognitive processing. In this perspective manuscript, we propose an approach of employing Personas as an alternative form of making large volumes of online user analytics information useful to end users of the user and customer analytics, with results applicable in software development, business sectors, communication industry, and other domains where understanding online user behavior is deemed important. Toward this end, we have developed a system that automatically generates data-driven Personas from social media and online analytics data, capable of handling hundreds of …"
Jisun AN,"1 One of the reasons for using personas is to align user understandings across project teams and sites. As part of a larger persona study, at Al Jazeera English (AJE), we conducted 16 qualitative interviews with media producers, the end users of persona descriptions. We asked the participants about their understanding of a typical AJE media consumer, and the variety of answers shows that the understandings are not aligned and are built on a mix of own experiences, own self, assumptions, and data given by the company. The answers are sometimes aligned with the data-driven personas and sometimes not. The end users are divided in two groups: news producers who have little interest in having data-based insights of news consumers and producers for social media platforms who have more interest in this information."
Jisun AN,"Framing is a process of emphasizing a certain aspect of an issue over the others, nudging readers or listeners towards different positions on the issue even without making a biased argument. Here, we propose FrameAxis, a method for characterizing documents by identifying the most relevant semantic axes (“microframes”) that are overrepresented in the text using word embedding. Our unsupervised approach can be readily applied to large datasets because it does not require manual annotations. It can also provide nuanced insights by considering a rich set of semantic axes. FrameAxis is designed to quantitatively tease out two important dimensions of how microframes are used in the text. Microframe bias captures how biased the text is on a certain microframe, and microframe intensity shows how prominently a certain microframe is used. Together, they offer a detailed characterization of the text. We demonstrate that microframes with the highest bias and intensity align well with sentiment, topic, and partisan spectrum by applying FrameAxis to multiple datasets from restaurant reviews to political news. The existing domain knowledge can be incorporated into FrameAxis by using custom microframes and by using FrameAxis as an iterative exploratory analysis instrument. Additionally, we propose methods for explaining the results of FrameAxis at the level of individual words and documents. Our method may accelerate scalable and sophisticated computational analyses of framing across disciplines."
Jisun AN,"Social media analytics is insightful but can also be difficult to use within organizations. To address this, we present Automatic Persona Generation (APG), a system and methodology for quantitatively generating personas using large amounts of online social media data. The APG system is operational, deployed in a pilot version with several organizations in multiple industry verticals. APG uses a robust web and stable back-end database framework to process tens of millions of user interactions with thousands of online digital products on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook and YouTube. APG identifies both distinct and impactful audience segments for an organization to create persona profiles by enhancing the social media analytics data with pertinent features, such as names, photos, interests, etc. We demonstrate the architecture development, and main system features. APG provides value for organizations distributing content via online platforms and is unique in its approach to leveraging social media data for audience understanding. APG is online at https://persona. qcri. org."
Jisun AN,"We investigate the alignment of international attention of news media organizations within 193 countries with the expressed international interests of the public within those same countries from March 7, 2016 to April 14, 2017. We collect fourteen months of longitudinal data of online news from Unfiltered News and web search volume data from Google Trends and build a multiplex network of media attention and public attention in order to study its structural and dynamic properties. Structurally, the media attention and the public attention are both similar and different depending on the resolution of the analysis. For example, we find that 63.2% of the country-specific media and the public pay attention to different countries, but local attention flow patterns, which are measured by network motifs, are very similar. We also show that there are strong regional similarities with both media and public attention that is only …"
Jisun AN,"In the last decades researchers have devoted a fair amount of effort to understand the news geography, ie a description of the general patterns for which countries are presented in which other countries’ news. These efforts presume that published opinion is a good enough proxy to infer such perception; indeed, that is the case when no other evidence is available. In this work we uncover a new point of view, that of consumers, relying on a rich data set related to the comments posted by users on the largest news media organization in the Middle East region, namely Aljazeera Network. Each comment comes with a body content, a unique identifier of the user, and her IP address, which makes it possible to infer the countries from which comments are posted. All in all, our analysis encompasses over 20,000 articles and more than 2 million comments posted by 90,000 unique readers. Such a rich data set allows us confronting for the first time–to the best of our knowledge–the producer-consumer standpoints."
Jisun AN,"In this paper, we propose a social relation aware routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks, which is designed for content sharing mobile social applications. Since a content can be shared by a group of users who have similar interests, the similarity of users' interests is a good metric to predict who will consume which contents. Shared interests can be exploited in routing and replication of content request and reply to achieve enhanced efficacy in content sharing. Since routing determines which content will be forwarded by whom, a route selected based on similarity of interest increases the utilization of contents replication in intermediate nodes. This paper describes the design and implementation of a social relation aware routing protocol that uses social relation as a part of routing metric. Simulation results shows that the proposed routing protocol improves higher delivery ratio with lower network overhead than …"
Jisun AN,"In this work, we analyze more than two million news photos published in January 2016. We demonstrate i) which objects appear the most in news photos; ii) what the sentiments of news photos are; iii) whether the sentiment of news photos is aligned with the tone of the text; iv) how gender is treated; and v) how differently political candidates are portrayed. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of news photo contents using deep learning-based vision APIs."
Jisun AN,"Given the ever increasing amount of publicly available social media data, there is growing interest in using online data to study and quantify phenomena in the offline “real” world. As social media data can be obtained in near real-time and at low cost, it is often used for “now-casting” indices such as levels of flu activity or unemployment. The term “social sensing” is often used in this context to describe the idea that users act as “sensors”, publicly reporting their health status or job losses. Sensor activity during a time period is then typically aggregated in a “one tweet, one vote” fashion by simply counting. At the same time, researchers readily admit that social media users are not a perfect representation of the actual population. Additionally, users differ in the amount of details of their personal lives that they reveal. Intuitively, it should be possible to improve now-casting by assigning different weights to different …"
Jisun AN,"We report findings and implications from a semi-naturalistic user study of a system for Automatic Persona Generation (APG) using large-scale audience data of an organization's social media channels conducted at the workplace of a major international corporation. Thirteen participants from a range of positions within the company engaged with the system in a use case scenario. We employed a variety of data collection methods, including mouse tracking and survey data, analyzing the data with a mixed method approach. Results show that having an interactive system may aid in keeping personas at the forefront while making customer-centric decisions and indicate that data-driven personas fulfill information needs of decision makers by mixing personas and numerical data. The findings have implications for the design of persona systems and the use of online analytics data to better understand users and customers."
Jisun AN,"The identification of meaningful audience segments, such as groups of users, consumers, readers, audience, etc., has important applicability in a variety of domains, including for content publishing. In this research, we seek to develop a technique for determining both information dissemination and information discrimination of online content in order to isolate audience segments. The benefits of the technique include identification of the most impactful content for analysis. With 4,320 online videos from a major news organization, a set of audience attributes, and more than 58 million interactions from hundreds of thousands of users, we isolate the key pieces of content in terms of identifying audience segments that are both (a) least and most discriminating in terms of audience segments and (b) the least and most impactful. By empirical methods, we show that 25.3 percent of the videos are so widely disseminated (i.e …"
Jisun AN,"Although used in many domains, the evaluation of personas is difficult due to the lack of validated measurement instruments. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Persona Perception Scale (PPS), a survey instrument for evaluating how individuals perceive personas. We develop the scale by reviewing relevant literature from social psychology, persona studies, and Human-Computer Interaction to find relevant constructs and items for measuring persona perceptions. Following initial pilot testing, we conduct an exploratory validation of the scale with 412 respondents and find that the constructs and items of the scale perform satisfactorily for deployment. The research has implications for both academic researchers and persona developers. Using the PPS, researchers and designers can evaluate how different persona designs affect individual perceptions of personas, for example persona users’ (e.g., designers …"
Jisun AN,"Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied but an increasingly important research direction. The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online, has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Alternatively, we can profile entire news outlets and look for those that are likely to publish fake or biased content. This approach makes it possible to detect likely ""fake news"" the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source. From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both, namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and how it describes itself on Twitter) vs. (ii) who read it (i.e., analyzing the readers of the target medium on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube). We further study (iii) what was written about the target medium on Wikipedia. The evaluation results show that what was written matters most, and that putting all information sources together yields huge improvements over the current state-of-the-art."
Jisun AN,"In this research, we evaluate the applicability of using facial recognition of social media account profile pictures to infer the demographic attributes of gender, race, and age of the account owners leveraging a commercial and well-known image service, specifically Face++. Our goal is to determine the feasibility of this approach for actual system implementation. Using a dataset of approximately 10,000 Twitter profile pictures, we use Face++ to classify this set of images for gender, race, and age. We determine that about 30% of these profile pictures contain identifiable images of people using the current state-of-the-art automated means. We then employ human evaluations to manually tag both the set of images that were determined to contain faces and the set that was determined not to contain faces, comparing the results to Face++. Of the thirty percent that Face++ identified as containing a face, about 80% are more likely than not the account holder based on our manual classification, with a variety of issues in the remaining 20%. Of the images that Face++ was unable to detect a face, we isolate a variety of likely issues preventing this detection, when a face actually appeared in the image. Overall, we find the applicability of automatic facial recognition to infer demographics for system development to be problematic, despite the reported high accuracy achieved for image test collections"
Jisun AN,"To more effectively convey relevant information to end users of persona profiles, we conducted a user study consisting of 29 participants engaging with three persona layout treatments. We were interested in confusion engendered by the treatments on the participants, and conducted a within-subjects study in the actual work environment, using eye-tracking and talk-aloud data collection. We coded the verbal data into classes of informativeness and confusion and correlated it with fixations and durations on the Areas of Interests recorded by the eye-tracking device. We used various analysis techniques, including Mann-Whitney, regression, and Levenshtein distance, to investigate how confused users differed from non-confused users, what information of the personas caused confusion, and what were the predictors of confusion of end users of personas. We consolidate our various findings into a confusion ratio …"
Jisun AN,"Predicting user confusion can help improve information presentation on websites, mobile apps, and virtual reality interfaces. One promising information source for such prediction is eye-tracking data about gaze movements on the screen. Coupled with think-aloud records, we explore if user's confusion is correlated with primarily fixation-level features. We find that random forest achieves an accuracy of more than 70% when prediction user confusion using only fixation features. In addition, adding user-level features (age and gender) improves the accuracy to more than 90%. We also find that balancing the classes before training improves performance. We test two balancing algorithms, Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) finding that SMOTE provides a higher performance increase. Overall, this research contains implications for researchers interested …"
Jisun AN,"It is known that news topics, covered more frequently and over longer periods of time, are considered to be important to the public. Hence, what gets media attention and how media attention evolves over time has been studied for decades in communication study. However, previous studies are confined to a few countries or a few topics, mainly due to lack of longitudinal global data. In this work, we use a large-scale news data compiled from 196 countries to provide empirical analyses of media attention dynamics."
Jisun AN,"Published by Reporters Without Borders every year, the Press Freedom Index (PFI) reflects the fear and tension in the newsroom pushed by the government and private sectors. While the PFI is invaluable in monitoring media environments worldwide, the current survey-based method has inherent limitations to updates in terms of cost and time. In this work, we introduce an alternative way to measure the level of press freedom using media attention diversity compiled from Unfiltered News."
Jisun AN,"Framing is an indispensable narrative device for news media because even the same facts may lead to conflicting understandings if deliberate framing is employed. Therefore, identifying media framing is a crucial step to understanding how news media influence the public. Framing is, however, difficult to operationalize and detect, and thus traditional media framing studies had to rely on manual annotation, which is challenging to scale up to massive news datasets. Here, by developing a media frame classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017. By examining the ebb and flow of media frames over almost two decades, we show that short-term frame abundance fluctuation closely corresponds to major events, while there also exist several long-term trends, such as the gradually increasing …"
Jisun AN,The Challenges of Creating Engaging Content: Results from a Focus Group Study of a Popular News Media Organization
Jisun AN,"With the advent of social media services, media outlets have started reaching audiences on social-networking sites. On Twitter, users actively follow a wide set of media sources, form interpersonal networks, and propagate interesting stories to their peers. These media subscription and interaction patterns, which had previously been hidden behind media corporations' databases, offer new opportunities to understand media supply and demand on a large scale. Through a map that connects 77 media outlets based on Twitter subscription patterns, we are able to answer a variety of questions: to what extent New York Times and the Wall Street Journal readers overlap? Are they competitors or potential collaborators? Are people who know each other more likely to subscribe to similar outlets?"
Jisun AN,"The exponential growth of social media as a central communication practice, and its agility in capturing and announcing breaking news events more rapidly than traditional media, has changed the journalistic landscape: social media has been adopted as a significant source by professional journalists, and conversely, citizens are able to use social media as a form of direct reportage. This brings along new opportunities for newsrooms and journalists by providing new means for newsgathering through access to a wealth of citizen reportage and updates about current affairs, as well as an additional showcase for news dissemination.In addition to being a big opportunity and having changed the day-to-day practices in the newsrooms, social media has introduced a number of challenges when it comes to newsgathering, verification, production, reporting and dissemination. These include real-time monitoring of …"
Jisun AN,"In this research, we conceptually examine the use of personas in an age of large-scale online analytics data. Based on the criticism and benefits outlined in prior work and by practitioners working with online data, we formulate the major arguments for and against the use of personas given real-time online analytics data about customers, analyze these arguments, and demonstrate areas for the productive employment of data-driven personas by leveraging online analytics data in their creation. Our key tenet is that data-driven personas are located between aggregated and individual customer statistics. At their best, digital data-driven personas capture the coverage of the customer base attributed to aggregated data representations while retaining the interpretability of individual-level analytics; they benefit from powerful computational techniques and novel data sources. We discuss how digital data-driven personas …"
Jisun AN,"Lack of diversity in advertising is a long-standing problem. Despite growing cultural awareness and missed business opportunities, many minorities remain under- or inappropriately represented in advertising. Previous research has studied how people react to culturally embedded ads, but such work focused mostly on print media or television using lab experiments. In this work, we look at diversity in content posted by 69 U.S. brands on two social media platforms, Instagram and Facebook. Using face detection technology, we infer the gender, race, and age of both the faces in the ads and of the users engaging with ads. Using this dataset, we investigate the following: (1) What type of content brands put out – Is there a lack of diversity?; (2) How does a brand’s content diversity compare to its audience diversity – Is any lack of diversity simply a reflection of the audience?; and (3) How does brand diversity …"
Jisun AN,"In this work, we empirically validate three common assumptions in building political media bias datasets, which are (i) labelers' political leanings do not affect labeling tasks,(ii) news articles follow their source outlet's political leaning, and (iii) political leaning of a news outlet is stable across different topics. We build a ground-truth dataset of manually annotated article-level political leaning and validate the three assumptions. Our findings warn that the three assumptions could be invalid even for a small dataset. We hope that our work calls attention to the (in) validity of common assumptions in building political media bias datasets."
Jisun AN,"Gender and racial diversity in the mediated images from the media shape our perception of different demographic groups. In this work, we investigate gender and racial diversity of 85,957 advertising images shared by the 73 top international brands on Instagram and Facebook. We hope that our analyses give guidelines on how to build a fully automated watchdog for gender and racial diversity in online advertisements."
Jisun AN,"We analyze cross-platform factors for posts on both single and multiple social media platforms for numerous news outlets to better predict audience engagement, precisely the number of likes and comments. We collect 676,779 social media posts from 53 news outlets during eight months on four social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube), along with the associated comments (more than 31 million) and the number of likes (more than 840 million). We develop a framework for predicting the audience engagement based on both linguistic features of the post and social media platform factors. Among other findings, results show that content with high engagement on one platform does not guarantee high engagement on another platform, even when news outlets use similar cross-platform posts; however, for some content, cross-sharing posts on a platform will increase overall audience …"
Jisun AN,"The objective of this study is to assess the longitudinal trends of media similarity and dissimilarity on the international scale. As news value has well-established political, cultural, and economic consequences, the degree to which media coverage and content is converging across countries has implications for international relations. To study this convergence, we use the daily data of the 100 topics that were over-reported in each country, compared to other countries, from March 7 to October 9, 2016. The results of this analysis indicate that two complementary patterns–globalization and domestication–explain the media attention across the countries. We conclude that this attention can be driven not only by geographical closeness but also by more complex dimensions, such as historical relationships. Also, although a group of countries often have common media attention, their similarity level depends on …"
Jisun AN,"The use of personas is an interactive design technique with considerable potential for product and content development. A persona is a representation of a group or segment of users, sharing common behavioral characteristics. Although representing a segment of users, a persona is generally developed in the form of a detailed narrative about an explicit but fictitious individual that represents the collection of users possessing similar behaviors or characteristics. In order to make the fictitious individual appear as real person to the product developers, the persona narrative usually contains a variety of both demographic and behavioral details about socio economic status, gender, hobbies, family members, friends, possessions, among many other data. Also, the narrative of a persona normally also addresses the goals, needs, wants, frustrations and other emotional aspects of the fictitious individual that are pertinent to …"
Jisun AN,"Using 103,133 news items collected from Daum News, the second most popular news portal in South Korea, we provide multidimensional analyses of gender and age differences in news consumption. We quantify such differences in four different dimensions: 1) by actual news items; 2) by topic 3) by issue; and 4) by angle. We found that angle preferences can better explain the difference of news consumptions, not topics nor issues."
Jisun AN,"The international rise of populism has been attributed, in part, to digital media. These media allow the backers of populists to share and distribute information independent of traditional media organizations or elites and offer communication spaces in which they can support each other and strengthen communal ties irrespective of their societal standing. Can we identify these functions in distinct usage patterns of digital media by supporters of populists? This could find expression through posting content that comports with the central tenets of populist ideology, higher activity levels, use of distinct vocabularies, and heightened levels of community building. We investigate differences along these dimensions on the online forum Reddit by comparing linguistic patterns and content of comments in two subreddits focusing on a populist, Donald Trump (/r/The_Donald), and a center-left politician, Hillary Clinton (/r …"
Jisun AN,"We built a multiplex media attention and disregard network (MADN) among 129 countries over 212 days. By characterizing the MADN from multiple levels, we found that it is formed primarily by skewed, hierarchical, and asymmetric relationships. Also, we found strong evidence that our news world is becoming a"" global village."" However, at the same time, unique attention blocks of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as well as Russia and its neighbors, still exist."
Jisun AN,"In this work, we analyze more than two million news photos published in January 2016. We demonstrate i) which objects appear the most in news photos; ii) what the sentiments of news photos are; iii) whether the sentiment of news photos is aligned with the tone of the text; iv) how gender is treated; and v) how differently political candidates are portrayed. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of news photo contents using deep learning-based vision APIs."
Jisun AN,"Utilization of multiple radio interfaces increases throughput of wireless networks. Existing work proposes a multi-radio routing protocol exploiting link quality and channel diversity of a path. While an established path is deteriorated by interferences incurred by any changes in a network, and existing work does not detect the deterioration. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware multi-radio routing protocol detecting and resolving dynamic path deterioration in wireless mesh networks."
Jisun AN,"We investigate predictors of anti-Asian hate among Twitter users throughout COVID-19. With the rise of xenophobia and polarization that has accompanied widespread social media usage in many nations, online hate has become a major social issue, attracting many researchers. Here, we apply natural language processing techniques to characterize social media users who began to post anti-Asian hate messages during COVID-19. We compare two user groups -- those who posted anti-Asian slurs and those who did not -- with respect to a rich set of features measured with data prior to COVID-19 and show that it is possible to predict who later publicly posted anti-Asian slurs. Our analysis of predictive features underlines the potential impact of news media and information sources that report on online hate and calls for further investigation into the role of polarized communication networks and news media."
Jisun AN,"To reach a broader audience and optimize traffic toward news articles, media outlets commonly run social media accounts and share their content with a short text summary. Despite its importance of writing a compelling message in sharing articles, the research community does not own a sufficient understanding of what kinds of editing strategies effectively promote audience engagement. In this study, we aim to fill the gap by analyzing media outlets’ current practices using a data-driven approach. We first build a parallel corpus of original news articles and their corresponding tweets that eight media outlets shared. Then, we explore how those media edited tweets against original headlines and the effects of such changes. To estimate the effects of editing news headlines for social media sharing in audience engagement, we present a systematic analysis that incorporates a causal inference technique with deep learning; using propensity score matching, it allows for estimating potential (dis-) advantages of an editing style compared to counterfactual cases where a similar news article is shared with a different style. According to the analyses of various editing styles, we report common and differing effects of the styles across the outlets. To understand the effects of various editing styles, media outlets could apply our easy-to-use tool by themselves."
Jisun AN,"As Internet users increasingly rely on social media sites to receive news, they are faced with a bewildering number of news media choices. For example, thousands of Facebook pages today are registered and categorized as some form of news media outlets. This situation boosted the so-called independent journalism, also known as alternative news media. Identifying and characterizing all the news pages that play an important role in news dissemination is key for understanding the news ecosystems of a country. In this work, we propose a graph-based semi-supervised method to measure the political bias of pages on most countries and show the political split of the alternative media, mainstream media, and public figures pages. We validate our method using the publicly available U.S. dataset and then apply it to Brazilian pages, where we found a larger number of right-wing pages in general, except for …"
Jisun AN,"In online social networks, it is common to use predictions of node categories to estimate measures of homophily and other relational properties. However, online social network data often lacks basic demographic information about the nodes. Researchers must rely on predicted node attributes to estimate measures of homophily, but little is known about the validity of these measures. We show that estimating homophily in a network can be viewed as a dyadic prediction problem, and that homophily estimates are unbiased when dyad-level residuals sum to zero in the network. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally have this property and can introduce large biases into homophily estimates. Bias occurs due to error autocorrelation along dyads. Importantly, node-level classification performance is not a reliable indicator of estimation accuracy for homophily. We compare estimation strategies that make predictions at the node and dyad levels, evaluating performance in different settings. We propose a novel ""ego-alter"" modeling approach that outperforms standard node and dyad classification strategies. While this paper focuses on homophily, results generalize to other relational measures which aggregate predictions along the dyads in a network. We conclude with suggestions for research designs to study homophily in online networks. Code for this paper is available at https://github.com/georgeberry/autocorr."
Jisun AN,"Examining 103,133 news articles that are the most popular for different demographic groups in Daum News (the second most popular news portal in South Korea) during the whole year of 2015, we provided multi-level analyses of gender and age differences in news consumption. We measured such differences in four different levels: (1) by actual news items, (2) by section, (3) by topic, and (4) by subtopic. We characterized the news items at the four levels by using the computational techniques, which are topic modeling and the vector representation of words and news items. We found that differences in news reading behavior across different demographic groups are the most noticeable in subtopic level but neither section nor topic levels."
Jisun AN,"Although established marketing techniques have been applied to design more effective health campaigns, more often than not, the same message is broadcasted to large populations, irrespective of unique characteristics. As individual digital device use has increased, so have individual digital footprints, creating potential opportunities for targeted digital health interventions. We propose a novel precision public health campaign framework to structure and standardize the process of designing and delivering tailored health messages to target particular population segments using social media–targeted advertising tools. Our framework consists of five stages: defining a campaign goal, priority audience, and evaluation metrics; splitting the target audience into smaller segments; tailoring the message for each segment and conducting a pilot test; running the health campaign formally; and evaluating the performance of the campaigns. We have demonstrated how the framework works through 2 case studies. The precision public health campaign framework has the potential to support higher population uptake and engagement rates by encouraging a more standardized, concise, efficient, and targeted approach to public health campaign development."
Jisun AN,"The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim or article, either manually or automatically. Thus, many researchers are shifting their attention to higher granularity, aiming to profile entire news outlets, which makes it possible to detect likely ""fake news"" the moment it is published, by simply checking the reliability of its source. Source factuality is also an important element of systems for automatic fact-checking and ""fake news"" detection, as they need to assess the reliability of the evidence they retrieve online. Political bias detection, which in the Western political landscape is about predicting left-center-right bias, is an equally important topic, which has experienced a similar shift towards profiling entire news outlets. Moreover, there is a clear connection between the two, as highly biased media are less likely to be factual; yet, the two problems have been addressed separately. In this survey, we review the state of the art on media profiling for factuality and bias, arguing for the need to model them jointly. We further discuss interesting recent advances in using different information sources and modalities, which go beyond the text of the articles the target news outlet has published. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline future research directions."
Jisun AN,"User engagement on social networks is essential for news outlets where they often distribute online content. News outlets simultaneously leverage multiple social media platforms to reach their overall audience and to increase marketshare. In this research, we analyze ten common stylistic features indicative of user engagement for news postings on multiple social media platforms. We display the stylistic features usage differences of news posts from various news sources. Results show that there are differences in the usage of stylistic features across social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube). Online news outlets can benefit from these findings in building guidelines for content editors and creators to create more users engaging postings."
Jisun AN,"We introduce Tanbih, a news aggregator with intelligent analysis tools to help readers understanding what's behind a news story. Our system displays news grouped into events and generates media profiles that show the general factuality of reporting, the degree of propagandistic content, hyper-partisanship, leading political ideology, general frame of reporting, and stance with respect to various claims and topics of a news outlet. In addition, we automatically analyse each article to detect whether it is propagandistic and to determine its stance with respect to a number of controversial topics."
Jisun AN,"Social media channels with audiences in the millions are increasingly common. Efforts at segmenting audiences for populations of these sizes can result in hundreds of audience segments, as the compositions of the overall audiences tend to be complex. Although understanding audience segments is important for strategic planning, tactical decision making, and content creation, it is unrealistic for human decision makers to effectively utilize hundreds of audience segments in these tasks. In this research, we present efforts at simplifying the segmentation of audience populations to increase their practical utility. Using millions of interactions with hundreds of thousands of viewers with an organization’s online content collection, we first isolate the maximum number of audience segments, based on behavioral profiling, and then demonstrate a computational approach of using non-negative matrix factorization …"
Jisun AN,"A social-based routing protocol for opportunistic networks considers the direct delivery as forwarding metrics. By ignoring the indirect delivery through intermediate nodes, it misses chances to find paths that are better in terms of delivery ratio and time. To overcome this limitation, we propose to incorporate transitivity, which considers the indirect delivery through intermediate nodes, as one of the forwarding metrics. We also found that some message forwards do not improve the delivery performance. To reduce the number of these useless forwards, the proposed scheme forwards messages to an encountered node when the increase of total utility value is greater than a threshold. Using a simulator with real world trace data sets, we compare the proposed scheme with the existing protocols, epidemic routing and SimBetTS. Compared with SimBetTS, the proposed scheme increases delivery ratio by 1.5 percent and …"
Jisun AN,"In this paper, we consider mobile ad hoc network routing protocols with respect to content sharing applications. We show that by utilizing social relations among participants, our routing protocols can improve its performance and efficiency of caching. Moreover, in certain situation which we can anticipate pattern of user's content consumption, our scheme can help such applications be more efficient in terms of access time and network overhead. Using NS2 simulator, we compare our scheme to DSDV and routing protocol using shortest path algorithm."
Jisun AN,"This research characterises user engagement of approximately 3,000,000 news postings of 53 news outlets and 50,000,000 associated user comments during 8 months on 5 social media platforms (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit). We investigate the effect of sentiments and topics on user engagement across four levels of user engagement expressions (i.e. views, likes, comments, cross-platform posting). We find that sentiments and topics differ by both news outlets and social media platforms, and both sentiments and topics by the four levels of user engagement expression. Finally, we predict a volume of four user engagement levels for given news content, with an 83% maximum average F1-score for the external posting of news articles from one platform to another using language and metadata features. Implications are that news outlets can benefit by developing a platform, sentiment and …"
Jisun AN,"Predictions of node categories are commonly used to estimate homophily and other relational properties in networks. However, little is known about the validity of using predictions for this task. We show that estimating homophily in a network is a problem of predicting categories of dyads (edges) in the graph. Homophily estimates are unbiased when predictions of dyad categories are unbiased. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally produce unbiased predictions of dyad categories and therefore produce biased homophily estimates. Bias comes from three sources: sampling bias, correlation between model errors and node degree, and correlation between node-level model errors along dyads. We examine three methods for estimating homophily: predicting node categories, predicting dyad categories, and a hybrid “ego–alter” approach. This analysis indicates that only the dyadic prediction approach is unbiased, whereas the node-level approach produces both high bias and high overall error. We find that node-level classification performance is not a reliable indicator of accuracy for homophily. Although this article focuses on a particular version of homophily, results generalize to heterophilous cases and other dyadic measures. We conclude with suggestions for research design. Code for this article is available at https://github.com/georgeberry/autocorr."

Jisun AN,"While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wreaked havoc across the globe, we have witnessed substantial mis- and disinformation regarding various aspects of the disease. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire for the general public (recruited via social media) and healthcare workers (recruited via email) from the State of Qatar, and the Middle East and North Africa region to understand the knowledge of and anxiety levels around COVID-19 (April–June 2020) during the early stage of the pandemic. The final dataset used for the analysis comprised of 1658 questionnaires (53.0% of 3129 received questionnaires; 1337 [80.6%] from the general public survey and 321 [19.4%] from the healthcare survey). Knowledge about COVID-19 was significantly different across the two survey populations, with a much higher proportion of healthcare workers possessing better COVID-19 knowledge than the general public (62.9% vs. 30.0%, p < 0.0001). A reverse effect was observed for anxiety, with a higher proportion of very anxious (or really frightened) respondents among the general public compared to healthcare workers (27.5% vs. 11.5%, p < 0.0001). A higher proportion of the general public tended to overestimate their chance of dying if they become ill with COVID-19, with 251 (18.7%) reporting the chance of dying (once COVID-19 positive) to be ≥25% versus 19 (5.9%) of healthcare workers (p < 0.0001). Good knowledge about COVID-19 was associated with low levels of anxiety. Panic and unfounded anxiety, as well as casual and carefree attitudes, can propel risk taking and mistake-making …"

Jisun AN,"The availability of large quantities of online data affords the isolation of key user segments based on demographics and behaviors for many online systems. However, there is an open question of how organizations can best leverage this user information in communication and decision-making. The automatic generation of personas to represent customer segments is an interactive design technique with considerable potential for product development, policy decision, and content creation. A persona is an imaginary but characteristic person that is the representation of a customer, audience, or user segment. The representative segment shares common characteristics in terms of behavioral attributes or demographics. Representing a user segment, a persona is generally developed in the form of a detailed profile narrative, typically expressed in one or two pages, about a representative but an imaginary individual that …"

Jisun AN,"In this work, we describe a methodology for leveraging large amounts of customer interaction data with online content from major social media platforms in order to isolate meaningful customer segments. The methodology is robust in that it can rapidly identify diverse customer segments using solely online behaviors and then associate these behavioral customer segments with the related distinct demographic segments, presenting a holistic picture of the customer base of an organization. We validate our methodology via the implementation of a working system that rapidly and in near real-time processes tens of millions of online customer interactions with content posted on major social media platforms in order to identify both the distinct behavioral segments and corresponding impactful demographic segments. We illustrate the functionality of the methodology with real data from a major online content provider with …"

Jisun AN,"The exponential growth of social media as a central communication practice, and its agility in capturing and announcing breaking news events more rapidly than traditional media, has changed the journalistic landscape: social media has been adopted as a significant source by professional journalists, and conversely, citizens are able to use social media as a form of direct reportage. This brings along new opportunities for newsrooms and journalists by providing new means for newsgathering through access to a wealth of citizen reportage and updates about current affairs, as well as an additional showcase for news dissemination. In addition to being a big opportunity and having changed the day-to-day practices in the newsrooms, social media has introduced a number of challenges when it comes to newsgathering, verification, production, reporting and dissemination. These include real time monitoring of streams, event detection, noise filtering, contextualisation, source and content verification, fact checking, annotation and archiving. The development of more advanced algorithms and tools for journalists requires not only furthering research in computational techniques, but also engaging more closely with journalists to understand how they work, what problems they’re facing when using social media, and how their day-to-day workflows can be improved.Social media are increasingly becoming the go-to platforms to get the news. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center found that as many as 62% Americans use social media to get the news1. Likewise, news organisations are now employing full-time social media editors, and major news …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we propose cyber foraging: a mechanism to augment the computational and storage capabilities of mobile devices. Cyber foraging uses opportunistically discovered servers in the environment to improve the performance of interactive applications and distributed file systems on mobile clients. We show how the performance of distributed file systems can be improved by staging data at these servers even though the servers are not trusted. We also show how the performance of interactive applications can be improved via remote execution. Finally, we present VERSUDS: a virtual interface to heteregeneous service discovery protocols that can be used to discover these servers."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Remote execution can transform the puniest mobile device into a computing giant able to run resource-intensive applications such as natural language translation, speech recognition, face recognition, and augmented reality. However, easily partitioning these applications for remote execution while retaining application-specific information has proven to be a difficult challenge. In this paper, we show that automated dynamic re-partitioning of mobile applications can be reconciled with the need to exploit application-specific knowledge. We show that the useful knowledge about an application relevant to remote execution can be captured in a compact declarative form called tactics. Tactics capture the full range of meaningful partitions of an application and are very small relative to code size. We present the design of a tactics-based remote execution system, Chroma, that performs comparably to a runtime system that makes perfect partitioning decisions. Furthermore, we show that Chroma can automatically use extra resources in an over-provisioned environment to improve application performance."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The rapid emergence of head-mounted devices such as the Microsoft Holo-lens enables a wide variety of continuous vision applications. Such applications often adopt deep-learning algorithms such as CNN and RNN to extract rich contextual information from the first-person-view video streams. Despite the high accuracy, use of deep learning algorithms in mobile devices raises critical challenges, ie, high processing latency and power consumption. In this paper, we propose DeepMon, a mobile deep learning inference system to run a variety of deep learning inferences purely on a mobile device in a fast and energy-efficient manner. For this, we designed a suite of optimization techniques to efficiently offload convolutional layers to mobile GPUs and accelerate the processing; note that the convolutional layers are the common performance bottleneck of many deep learning models. Our experimental results show …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Cyber foraging is the transient and opportunistic use of compute servers bymobile devices. The short market life of such devices makes rapid modification of applications for remote execution an important problem. We describe a solution that combines a"" little language"" for cyber foraging with an adaptive runtime system. We report results from a user study showing that even novice developers are able to successfully modify large, unfamiliar applications in just a few hours. We also show that the quality of novice-modified and expert-modified applications are comparable in most cases."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we describe the design, analysis, implementation, and operational deployment of a real-time trip information system that provides passengers with the expected fare and trip duration of the taxi ride they are planning to take. This system was built in cooperation with a taxi operator that operates more than 15,000 taxis in Singapore. We first describe the overall system design and then explain the efficient algorithms used to achieve our predictions based on up to 21 months of historical data consisting of approximately 250 million paid taxi trips. We then describe various optimisations (involving region sizes, amount of history, and data mining techniques) and accuracy analysis (involving routes and weather) we performed to increase both the runtime performance and prediction accuracy. Our large scale evaluation demonstrates that our system is (a) accurate---with the mean fare error under 1 Singapore …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The inclusion of the barometer sensor in smartphones signaled an opportunity for aiding indoor localization efforts. In this paper, we therefore investigate a possible use of the barometer sensor for detecting vertically oriented activities. We start by showing the accuracies of various commodity measurement devices and the challenges they bring forth. We then show how to use the barometer values to build a predictor that can detect floor changes and the mode (elevator, escalator, or stairs) used to change floors with nearly 100% accuracy. We validate these properties with data collected using 3 different measurement devices from 7 different buildings. Our investigation reveals that while the barometer sensor has potential, there is still a lot left to be desired."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Software firms are increasingly distributing their software development effort across multiple locations. In this paper we present the results of a two year field study that investigated the effects of dispersion on the productivity and quality of distributed software development. We first develop a model of distributed software development. We then use the model, along with our empirically observed data, to understand the consequences of dispersion on software project performance. Our analysis reveals that, even in high process maturity environments, a) dispersion significantly reduces development productivity and has effects on conformance quality, and b) these negative effects of dispersion can be significantly mitigated through deployment of structured software engineering processes."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we show how tone mapping techniques can be used to dynamically increase the image brightness, thus allowing the LCD backlight levels to be reduced. This saves significant power as the majority of the LCD's display power is consumed by its backlight. The Gamma function (or equivalent) can be efficiently implemented in smartphones with minimal resource cost. We describe how we overcame the Gamma function's non-linear nature by using adaptive thresholds to apply different Gamma values to images with differing brightness levels. These adaptive thresholds allow us to save significant amounts of power while preserving the image quality. We implemented our solution on a laptop and two Android smartphones. Finally, we present measured analytical results for two different games (Quake III and Planeshift), and user study results (using Quake III and 60 participants) that shows that we can save …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we examined the impact of project-level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity, quality, and profits. Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Target imaging and material identification play an important role in many real-life applications. This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commercial off the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials and target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target;(ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation distances …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Real-time monitoring of groups and their rich contexts will be a key building block for futuristic, group-aware mobile services. In this paper, we propose GruMon, a fast and accurate group monitoring system for dense and complex urban spaces. GruMon meets the performance criteria of precise group detection at low latencies by overcoming two critical challenges of practical urban spaces, namely (a) the high density of crowds, and (b) the imprecise location information available indoors. Using a host of novel features extracted from commodity smartphone sensors, GruMon can detect over 80% of the groups, with 97% precision, using 10 minutes latency windows, even in venues with limited or no location information. Moreover, in venues where location information is available, GruMon improves the detection latency by up to 20% using semantic information and additional sensors to complement traditional spatio …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Wireless networks have become increasingly common and an increasing number of devices are communicating with each other over lossy links. Unfortunately, TCP performs poorly over lossy links as it is unable to differentiate the loss due to packet corruption from that due to congestion. We present an extension to TCP which enables TCP to distinguish packet corruption from congestion in lossy environments resulting in improved performance. We refer to this extension as the HeAder ChecKsum option (HACK). We implemented our algorithm in the Linux kernel and performed various tests to determine its effectiveness. Our results have shown that HACK performs substantially better than both SACK and NewReno in cases where burst corruptions are frequent. We also found that HACK can co-exist very nicely with SACK and performs even better with SACK enabled."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We explore the use of gesture recognition on a wrist-worn smartwatch as an enabler of an automated eating activity (and diet monitoring) system. We show, using small-scale user studies, how it is possible to use the accelerometer and gyroscope data from a smartwatch to accurately separate eating episodes from similar non-eating activities, and to additionally identify the mode of eating (i.e., using a spoon, bare hands or chopsticks). Additionally, we investigate the likelihood of automatically triggering the smartwatch's camera to capture clear images of the food being consumed, for possible offline analysis to identify what (and how much) the user is eating. Our results show both the promise and challenges of this vision: while opportune moments for capturing such useful images almost always exist in an eating episode, significant further work is needed to both (a) correctly identify the appropriate instant when the …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a near-field communication-based mobile p2p payment application, called mFerio, that is designed to replace cash-based transactions. We first identify design criteria that payment systems should satisfy and then explain how mFerio, relative to those criteria, improves on the limitations of cash-based systems. We next describe mFerio's implementation and user interface design, focusing on the balance between usability and security. Finally, we present the results of a two-phase user study, involving a total of 104 people, that shows that mFerio has low cognitive load and is also fast, accurate, and easy to use-even outperforming cash in terms of speed and cognitive load in common payment situations."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"A method, system, and computer program for executing a network-based distributed application. An infrastructure is described that includes application containers configured to execute an application instance of the distributed application and measure quality of service metrics for the application instance. Workload management elements form a decentralized workload management layer. The workload management layer is configured to assign a workload to application containers based on the quality of service metrics received by the application containers."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Focus, a system for effectively and efficiently reducing power consumption of OLED displays on smartphones. These displays, while becoming exceedingly common still consume significant power. The key idea of Focus is that we use the notion of saliency to save display power by dimming portions of the applications that are less important to the user. We envision Focus being especially useful during low battery situations when usability is less important than power savings. We tested Focus using 15 applications running on a Samsung Galaxy S III and show that it saves, on average, between 23 to 34% of the OLED display power with little impact on task completion times. Finally, we present the results of a user study, involving 30 participants that shows that Focus, even with its dimming behaviour, is still quite usable."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Building a distributed middleware infrastructure that provides the low latency required for massively multiplayer games while still maintaining consistency is non-trivial. Previous attempts have used static partitioning or client-based peer-to-peer techniques that do not scale well to a large number of players, perform poorly under dynamic workloads or hotspots, and impose significant programming burdens on game developers. We show that it is possible to build a scalable distributed system, called Matrix, that is easily usable by game developers. We show experimentally that Matrix provides good performance, especially when hotspots occur."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Recently, a branch of machine learning algorithms called deep learning gained huge attention to boost up accuracy of a variety of sensing applications. However, execution of deep learning algorithm such as convolutional neural network on mobile processor is non-trivial due to intensive computational requirements. In this paper, we present our early design of DeepSense-a mobile GPU-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. For its design, we first explored the differences between server-class and mobile-class GPUs, and studied effectiveness of various optimization strategies such as branch divergence elimination and memory vectorization. Our results show that DeepSense is able to execute a variety of CNN models for image recognition, object detection and face recognition in soft real time with no or marginal accuracy tradeoffs. Experiments also show that our framework is scalable …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Driven by the rapid market growth of sensors and beacons that offer Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based connectivity, this paper empirically investigates the performance characteristics of the BLE interface on multiple Android smartphones, and the consequent impact on a proposed BLE-based service: continuous indoor location. We first use extensive measurement studies with multiple Android devices to establish that the BLE interface on current smartphones is not as ""low-energy"" as nominally expected, and establish that continuous use of such a BLE interface is not feasible unless we choose a moderately large scan interval and a low duty cycle. We then explore the implications of such constraints, on the parameters of a smart phone's BLE stack, on the accuracy of a BLE-based indoor localization techniques. We show that while RF-based indoor location can be highly accurate (80% of estimates have errors …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present LiveLabs, a mobile experimentation testbed that is currently deployed across our university campus with further deployments at a large shopping mall, a commercial airport, and a resort island soon to follow. The key goal of LiveLabs is to allow in-situ real-time experimentation of mobile applications and services that require context-specific triggers with real participants on their actual smart phones. We describe how LiveLabs works, and then explain the novel R&D required to realise it. We end with a description of the current LiveLabs status (> 700 active participants to date) as well as present some key lessons learned."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Advertisements are the de-facto currency of the Internet with many popular applications (eg Angry Birds) and online services (eg, YouTube) relying on advertisement generated revenue. However, the current economic models and mechanisms for mobile advertising are fundamentally not sustainable and far from ideal. In particular, as we show, applications which use mobile advertising are capable of using significant amounts of a mobile users' critical resources without being controlled or held accountable. This paper seeks to redress this situation by enabling advertisement supported applications to become significantly more``user-friendly''. To this end, we present the design and implementation of CAMEO, a new framework for mobile advertising that 1) employs intelligent and proactive retrieval of advertisements, using context prediction, to significantly reduce the bandwidth and energy overheads of advertising …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We describe how we studied, in-situ, the operational processes of three large high process maturity distributed software development companies and discovered three common problems they faced with respect to early stage project cost estimation. We found that project managers faced significant challenges to accurately estimate project costs because the standard metrics-based estimation tools they used (a) did not effectively incorporate diverse distributed project configurations and characteristics, (b) required comprehensive data that was not fully available for all starting projects, and (c) required significant domain experience to derive accurate estimates. To address these challenges, we collaborated with practitioners at the three firms and developed a new learning-oriented and semi-automated early-stage cost estimation solution that was specifically designed for globally distributed software projects. The key …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we show that characterizing user behaviour from location or smartphone usage traces, without accounting for the interaction of individuals in physical-world groups, can lead to erroneous results. We conducted one of the largest studies in the UbiComp domain thus far, involving indoor location traces of more than 6,000 users, collected over a 4-month period at our university campus, and further studied fine-grained App usage of a subset of 156 Android users. We apply a state-of-the-art group detection algorithm to annotate such location traces with group vs. individual context, and then show that individuals vs. groups exhibit significant differences along three behavioural traits:(1) the mobility pattern,(2) the responsiveness to calls/SMSs and (3) application usage. We show that these significant differences are robust to underlying errors in the group detection technique and that the use of such group …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Mobile gaming has become increasingly popular in the past few years with the proliferation of smartphones that have the increased CPU, memory, and network (3.5 G etc.) capabilities to support a vast range of interesting games. In addition, these phones also have high quality displays, such as Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) displays, that allow the intricate details in games to be shown in vivid detail to end users. Unfortunately, these displays tend to consume a lot of energy-which in turn limits the amount of time that a user can spend actually playing games on these devices. In this paper, we describe a technique that makes use of saliency, with respect to the end user, to reduce the power consumption of OLED displays when they are used for games, by reducing the brightness of game areas that are not of interest currently to the game player. We evaluated our technique with a user study and showed that …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Contact tracing is a well-established and effective approach for the containment of the spread of infectious diseases. While Bluetooth-based contact tracing method using phones has become popular recently, these approaches suffer from the need for a critical mass adoption to be effective. In this paper, we present WiFiTrace, a network-centric approach for contact tracing that relies on passive WiFi sensing with no client-side involvement. Our approach exploits WiFi network logs gathered by enterprise networks for performance and security monitoring, and utilizes them for reconstructing device trajectories for contact tracing. Our approach is specifically designed to enhance the efficacy of traditional methods, rather than to supplant them with new technology. We designed an efficient graph algorithm to scale our approach to large networks with tens of thousands of users. The graph-based approach outperforms an …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Consumers expect their mobile devices to be small and light, have a decent battery lifetime, and still be powerful enough to run all their desired applications. The need to satisfy such consumer demands has driven mobile-device manufacturers to make products (such as PDAs and cell phones) that match these needs. However, this inevitably requires tradeoffs. Building smaller, lighter devices requires sacrificing the device's battery capacity because battery technology is still fairly dense and heavy, and contributes most of a mobile device's size and weight. But, mobile devices with the required resources to run useful desktop applications need additional battery power to run those resources for a reasonable length of time. Because the tension facing manufacturers appears to be in deciding the battery-weight and battery-performance tradeoffs, the solution seems to lie in finding ways to increase a mobile device's …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present the results of a three year field study of the software development process choices made by project teams at two leading offshore vendors. In particular, we focus on the performance implications of project teams that chose to augment structured, plan-driven processes to implement the CMM level-5 key process areas (KPAs) with agile methods. Our analysis of 112 software projects reveals that the decision to augment the firm-recommended, plan-driven approach with improvised, agile methods was significantly affected by the extent of client knowledge and involvement, the newness of technology, and the project size. Furthermore this decision had a significant and mostly positive impact on project performance indicators such as reuse, rework, defect density, and productivity."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We believe that, for successful adoption of novel mobile technologies and applications, it is important to be able to test them under real usage patterns, and with real users. To implement this vision, we present our initial effort in building LiveLabs, a large-scale mobile testbed for in-situ experimentation. LiveLabs is unique in two aspects. First, LiveLabs operates on a scale much larger than most research testbeds it is being deployed in four different public spaces in Singapore (a university campus, a shopping mall, an airport and a leisure resort), and is expected to have a pool of over 30,000 opt-in participants. Second, LiveLabs not only instruments smartphones and the infrastructure to gather deep individual and collective context, but also provides a unique experimentation platform that automates many aspects of behavioral experimentation, such as subject selection and context-triggered delivery of interventions …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Remote execution has commonly been used to allow mobile devices to run large computationally intensive applications such as language translation and optical character recognition. Traditionally, most remote execution systems have concentrated on resource-limited environments. However, with the sharp decrease in the price of computing, it is not inconceivable that environments with an abundance of computing resources will soon become the norm. In this paper, we investigate a solution, known as “data decomposition”, that exploits these excess resource to improve application latency. We identify the kinds of applications that might benefit from this solution. We then describe how we extended an existing remote execution system to support data decomposition. We then present results, for three real applications, that show that data decomposition can greatly improve application latency–up to 85% in some cases compared with using just a single remote execution server. We also present results that show the effect of data decomposition in heterogeneous environments. Our results suggest that data decomposition can be used fairly, without global knowledge, by multiple clients."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Mobile games, and especially multiplayer games are a very popular daily distraction for many users. We hypothesise that commuters travelling on public buses or trains would enjoy being able to play multiplayer games with their fellow commuters to alleviate the commute burden and boredom. We present quantitative data to show that the typical one-way commute time is fairly long (at least 25 minutes on average) as well as survey results indicating that commuters are willing to play multiplayer games with other random commuters. In this paper, we present GameOn, a system that allows commuters to participate in multiplayer games with each other using p2p networking techniques that reduces the need to use high latency and possibly expensive cellular data connections. We show how GameOn uses a cloud-based matchmaking server to eliminate the overheads of discovery as well as show why GameOn uses …"

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present LiveLabs, a first-of-its-kind testbed that is deployed across a university campus, convention centre, and resort island and collects real-time attributes such as location, group context etc., from hundreds of opt-in participants. These venues, data, and participants are then made available for running rich human-centric behavioural experiments that could test new mobile sensing infrastructure, applications, analytics, or more social-science type hypotheses that influence and then observe actual user behaviour. We share case studies of how researchers from around the world have and are using LiveLabs, and our experiences and lessons learned from building, maintaining, and expanding Live-Labs over the last three years."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Current mobile devices embrace a wide range of functionalities including high speed network support, hardware accelerated 3D graphics, and multimedia capabilities. These capabilities have boosted the interest for enabling multiplayer online games (MOG) support on such devices. However, the lack of similar growth in battery technology limits the usability of these devices for MOGs. In this paper, we present energy conservation techniques for highly interactive MOGs. These are games, such as first-person shooters, where crisp user interaction is paramount to the overall game experience. Hence, conserving energy while preserving crisp user interaction becomes a critical consideration in this domain. We first present three obvious power management approaches and highlight their limitations. We then discuss two application-assisted approaches for power management that manage to save power while …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we highlight the challenge of continuously sensing context data from mobile phones. In particular, we show that the energy cost of this type of continuous sensing is extremely high if a) accuracy is desired, and b) power optimisations do not work well if multiple tasks are sensing concurrently. Our results are derived from our experience in building the LiveLabs context sensing platform. We present results for different types of sensing tasks; ranging from simple sensing using just one sensor all the way to multi-sensor sensing performed by concurrent high-level tasks. We end with a discussion of the challenges of supporting multi-task sensing across heterogeneous devices and operating systems."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Growth in the adoption of distributed software development business models continues to outpace the development of robust governance schemes for them. In the absence of specific well-tested governance schemes, distributed software teams continue to employ the normative process frameworks, and software engineering practices that were primarily developed in the co-located context. In this position paper, we present a possible research direction for developing and testing governance schemes specifically suited for distributed software development projects. Our proposal draws examples from our recent research initiatives and presents an actionable road map for researchers and practitioners who are working towards establishing governance schemes for distributed software teams."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Privacy protection against mobile applications on mobile devices is becoming a serious concern as user sensitive data may be leaked without proper justification. Most current leak detection tools only report leaked private data, but provide inadequate information about the causes of the leaks for end users to take preventive measures. Hence, users often cannot reconcile the way they have used an application to a reported leak---ie, they are unable to comprehend the (il) legitimacy of the leak or make a decision on whether to allow the leak. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of identifying the causes of leaks from a user's point of view, which we call mobile forensics of privacy leaks. Its goal is to correlate user actions to leaks, and report the causes from a user-oriented perspective. To make the case, we have performed a preliminary study that identifies leak causes based on logs of user …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the GPS-enabled taxi dispatch system used by the world’s second largest land transportation company. We first summarize the collective dynamics of the more than 6,000 taxicabs in this fleet. Next, we propose a simple method for evaluating the efficiency of the system over a given period of time and geographic zone. Our method yields valuable insights into system performance—in particular, revealing significant inefficiencies that should command the attention of the fleet operator. For example, despite the state of the art dispatching system employed by the company, we find imbalances in supply and demand during peak business hours, often resulting in unacceptably high waiting times for passengers. Surprisingly, we also find imbalances during off-peak hours in certain zones. Finally, we discuss how techniques from multi-agent systems research, such as distributed coordination and market-based resource allocation, may be effective in improving the performance of this important mode of public transportation."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper discusses the application of TCP tunnels on the Internet and how Internet traffic can benefit from the congestion control mechanism of the tunnels. Primarily, we show the TCP tunnels offer TCP-friendly flows protection from TCP-unfriendly traffic. TCP tunnels also reduce the many flows situation on the Internet to that of a few flows. In addition, TCP tunnels eliminate unnecessary packet loss in the core routers of the congested backbones, which waste precious bandwidth leading to congestion collapse due to unresponsive UDP flows. We finally highlight that the use of TCP tunnels can, in principle, help prevent certain forms of congestion collapse described by Floyd and Fall [IEEE/ACM Trans Networking 7 (4) (1999) 458].The deployment of TCP tunnels on the Internet and the issues involved are also discussed and we conclude that with the recent RFC2309 recommendation of using random early drop as …"

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The rapid proliferation of mobile handheld computing devices, such as cellphones and PDAs, has led to an unfortunate conflict. On one hand, we have light mobile computing devices that can be carried anywhere. However, on the other hand, these devices are frequently unable to execute applications that are of highest value to a mobile user such as language translators and speech recognizers. One way to resolve this conflict is to use cyber foraging---utilize compute resources available in the environment to augment the capabilities of mobile devices."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We espouse a vision of small data-based immersive retail analytics, where a combination of sensor data, from personal wearable-devices and store-deployed sensors & IoT devices, is used to create real-time, individualized services for in-store shoppers. Key challenges include (a) appropriate joint mining of sensor & wearable data to capture a shopper's product-level interactions, and (b) judicious triggering of power-hungry wearable sensors (e.g., camera) to capture only relevant portions of a shopper's in-store activities. To explore the feasibility of our vision, we conducted experiments with 5 smartwatch-wearing users who interacted with objects placed on cupboard racks in our lab (to crudely mimic corresponding grocery store interactions). Initial results show significant promise: 94% accuracy in identifying an item-picking gesture, 85% accuracy in identifying the shelf-location from where the item was picked and …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper presents a framework for engineering resource-adaptive software systems targeted at small mobile devices. The proposed framework empowers users to control tradeoffs among a rich set of ervicespecific aspects of quality of service. After motivating the problem, the paper proposes a model for capturing user preferences with respect to quality of service, and illustrates prototype user interfaces to elicit such models. The paper then describes the extensions and integration work made to accommodate the proposed framework on top of an existing software infrastructure for ubiquitous computing. The research question addressed here is the feasibility of coordinating resource allocation and adaptation policies in a way that end-users can understand and control in real time. The evaluation covered both systems and the usability perspectives, the latter by means of a user study. The contributions of this work are: first, a set of design guidelines for resource-adaptive systems, including APIs for integrating new applications; second, a concrete infrastructure that implements the guidelines. And third, a way to model quality of service tradeoffs based on utility theory, which our research indicates end-users with diverse backgrounds are able to leverage for guiding the adaptive behaviors towards activity-specific quality goals."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present QueueVadis, a system that addresses the problem of estimating, in real-time, the properties of queues at commonplace urban locations, such as coffee shops, taxi stands and movie theaters. Abjuring the use of any queuing-specific infrastructure sensors, QueueVadis uses participatory mobile sensing to detect both (i) the individual-level queuing episodes for any arbitrarily-shaped queue (by a characteristic locomotive signature of short bursts of"" shuffling forward"" between periods of"" standing"") and (ii) the aggregate-level queue properties (such as expected wait or service times) via appropriate statistical aggregation of multi-person data. Moreover, for venues where multiple queues are too close to be separated via location estimates, QueueVadis also uses a novel disambiguation technique to separate users into multiple distinct queues. User studies, performed with 138 cumulative total users observed …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Understanding the engagement levels players have with a game is a useful proxy for evaluating the game design and user experience. This is particularly important for mobile games as an alternative game is always just an easy download away. However, engagement is a subjective concept and usually requires fine-grained highly disruptive interviews or surveys to determine accurately. In this paper, we present EngageMon, a first-of-its-kind system that uses a combination of sensors from the smartphone (touch events), a wristband (photoplethysmography and electrodermal activity sensor readings), and an external depth camera (skeletal motion information) to accurately determine the engagement level of a mobile game player. Our design was guided by feedback obtained from interviewing 22 mobile game developers, testers, and designers. We evaluated EngageMon using data collected from 64 participants …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We make the case for cloud-enabled mobile sensing services that support an emerging application class, one which infers near-real time collective context using sensor data obtained continuously from a large set of consumer mobile devices. We present the high-level architecture and functional requirements for such a mobile sensing service, and argue that such a service can significantly improve the scalability and energy-efficiency of large-scale mobile sensing by coordinating the sensing & processing tasks across multiple devices. We then focus specifically on the problem of energy-efficiency and provide early exemplars of how optimizing query execution jointly over multiple phones can lead to substantial energy savings."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"With the improved processing power, graphic quality and high-speed wireless connection in recent generations of mobile phone, it looks more attractive than ever to introduce networked games on these devices. While device features and application resource requirements are rapidly growing, the battery technologies are not growing at the same pace. Networked Mobile games are a class of application, which consume higher levels of energy, as they are naturally more computationally intensive and use hardware components including audio, display and network to their fullest capacities. Therefore, the main concern is the limitation of the battery power of such portable devices to support the potentially long-hour of game play. In this paper we present ARIVU, a power aware middleware that dynamically controls the energy consumption of wireless interface based on the game and system state while maintaining the …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper examines the attributes of TCP tunnels which are TCP circuits that carry IP packets and benefit from the congestion control mechanism of TCP/IP. The deployment of TCP tunnels reduces the many flows situation on the Internet to that of a few flows. TCP tunnels eliminate unnecessary packet loss in the core routers of the congested backbones which waste precious bandwidth leading to congestion collapse due to unresponsive UDP flows. We also highlight that the use of TCP tunnels can, in principle, help prevent certain forms of congestion collapse described by Floyd & Fall (see IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, vol.7, no.4, p.458-72, 1999). Using a testbed often Intel PCs running the Linux operating system and traffic generators simulating user applications, we explore: the benefits which TCP tunnels confer upon its payload of user IP traffic; the impact on the congestion within network backbones …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"While automated testing of mobile applications is very useful for checking run-time behaviours and specifications, its capability in discovering issues in apps is often limited in practice due to long testing time. A common practice is to randomly and exhaustively explore the whole app test space, which takes a lot of time and resource to achieve good coverage and reach targeted parts of the apps."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper describes our experiences and observations with a localization system that continuously tracks the indoor location of a large number of consumer mobile devices. Unlike past work that focuses principally on the accuracy of the location tracking algorithm, we study the performance of the localization system in terms of key additional metrics: scalability and energy-efficiency, which can sometimes conflict with the desire for high accuracy. To ensure that our solution can handle both Android and iOS-based mobile devices (& other closed mobile platforms), we adapt the conventional client-side fingerprinting-based localization approaches to develop a novel and practical infrastructure-based location tracking strategy. We study the relative accuracy to the two approaches in two different types of indoor buildings. Our studies establish how the building and its occupancy characteristics affect the accuracy …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present VitaMon, a mobile sensing system that can measure the inter-heartbeat interval (IBI) from the facial video captured by a commodity smartphone's front camera. The continuous IBI measurement is used to compute heart rate variability (HRV), one of the most important markers of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. The underlying idea of VitaMon is that video recording of human face contains multiple cardiovascular pulse signals with different phase shift. Our measurement on 10 participants shows the significant time delay (36.79 ms) between the pulse signals measured at the jaw region and forehead region. VitaMon leverages deep neural network models to extract both spatial and temporal information of the video to reconstruct a pulse waveform signal that is optimized for estimating IBI. We evaluated VitaMon with a dataset collected from 30 participants under various conditions involving …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present ideas for Multi-modal protocols. These are protocols which alter/determine their operating mode depending on the environment. We identify the challenges involved in coming up with a suitable architecture for a protocol stack supporting multiple modes of operation. We present a framework for a Multi-modal network stack. To exemplify the issues involved, we consider the example of a Multi-modal transport layer. We discuss the modifications that can be done at the transport layer (TCP) for end-systems to conserve power. These modifications each map onto a different mode of operation. We identify scenarios where our algorithms perform well, based on simulations in ns2 as well as transfers over the Internet. We show that it is possible to save power by using various operating modes at the transport layer."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Energy harvesting, from a diverse set of modes such as light or motion, has been viewed as the key to developing batteryless sensing devices. In this paper, we develop the nascent idea of harvesting RF energy from WiFi transmissions, applying it to power a prototype wearable device that captures and transmits accelerometer sensor data. Our solution, WiWear, has two key innovations: 1) beamforming WiFi transmissions to significantly boost the energy that a receiver can harvest ~23 meters away, and 2) smart zero-energy, triggering of inertial sensing, that allows intelligent duty-cycled operation of devices whose transient power consumption far exceeds what can be instantaneously harvested. We provide experimental validation, using both careful measurement studies as well as a controlled study with human participants, to show the viability of a custom-built WiWear-based wearable device, at least in office …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"While mobile and wearable sensing can capture unique insights into fine-grained activities (such as gestures and limb-based actions) at an individual level, their energy overheads are still prohibitive enough to prevent them from being executed continuously. In this paper, we explore practical alternatives to addressing this challenge-by exploring how cheap infrastructure sensors or information sources (e.g., BLE beacons) can be harnessed with such mobile/wearable sensors to provide an effective solution that reduces energy consumption without sacrificing accuracy. The key idea is that many fine-grained activities that we desire to capture are specific to certain location, movement or background context: infrastructure sensors and information sources (e.g., BLE beacons) offer practical and cheap ways to identify such context. In this paper, we first explore how various infrastructure, mobile & wearable sensors can …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Dimorphic computing is a new model of computing that switches between thick and thin client modes of execution in a completely automated and transparent manner. It accomplishes this without imposing any language or structural requirements on applications. This model greatly improves the performance of applications that alternate between phases of compute-or data-intensive processing and intense user interaction. For such applications, the thin client mode allows efficient use of remote resources such as compute servers or large datasets. The thick client mode enables crisp interactive performance by eliminating the harmful effects of Internet latency and jitter, and by exploiting local graphical hardware acceleration. We demonstrate the feasibility and value of dimorphic computing through AgentISR, a prototype that exploits virtual machine technology. Experiments with AgentISR confirm that the performance of a number of widely-used scientific and graphic arts applications can be significantly improved without requiring any modification.This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant numbers CNS-0509004 and CCR-0205266, the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada under grant number 261545-3 and a Canada Graduate Scholarship, by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the Ontario Innovation Trust OIT) under grant number 7739.

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present a new way of generating behavioral (not biometric) fingerprints from the cellphone usage data. In particular, we explore if the generated behavioral fingerprints are memorable enough to be remembered by end users. We built a system, called HuMan, that generates fingerprints from cellphone data. To test HuMan, we conducted an extensive user study that involved collecting about one month of continuous usage data (including calls, SMSes, application usage patterns etc.) from 44 Symbian and Android smartphone users. We evaluated the memorable fingerprints generated from this rich multi-context data by asking each user to answer various authentication questions generated from the fingerprints. Results show that the fingerprints generated by HuMan are remembered by the user to some extent and were moderately secure against attacks even by family members and close friends."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"A critical factor for the commercial success of mobile and task-specific devices is the fast turnaround time of software development. However, developing software for mobile devices is especially hard since applications need to be aware of and adapt to changing resources such as bandwidth and battery."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Mobile sensing has played a key role in providing digital solutions to aid with COVID-19 containment policies. These solutions include, among other efforts, enforcing social distancing and monitoring crowd movements in indoor spaces. However, such solutions may not be effective without mass adoption. As more and more countries reopen from lockdowns, there remains a pressing need to minimize crowd movements and interactions, particularly in enclosed spaces. This paper conjectures that analyzing user occupancy and mobility via deployed WiFi infrastructure can help institutions monitor and maintain safety compliance according to the public health guidelines. Using smartphones as a proxy for user location, our analysis demonstrates how coarse-grained WiFi data can sufficiently reflect indoor occupancy spectrum when different COVID-19 policies were enacted. Our work analyzes staff and students' mobility data from three different university campuses. Two of these campuses are in Singapore, and the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our results show that online learning, split-team, and other space management policies effectively lower occupancy. However, they do not change the mobility for individuals transitioning between spaces. We demonstrate how this data source can be put to practical application for institutional crowd control and discuss the implications of our findings for policy-making."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We describe the design and implementation of a smartwatch-based, completely unobtrusive, food journaling system, where the smartwatch helps to intelligently capture useful images of food that an individual consumes throughout the day. The overall system, called Annapurna, is based on three key components: (a) a smartwatch-based gesture recognizer to identify eating gestures, (b) a smartwatch-based image capturer that obtains a small set of relevant and useful images with a low energy overhead, and (c) a server-based image filtering engine that removes irrelevant uploaded images, and then catalogs them through a portal. Our primary challenge is to make the system robust to the huge diversity in natural eating habits and food choices. We show how we address this by an appropriate coupling between a smartwatch's camera sensor and inertial sensor-based tracking of eating gestures, thereby helping to …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The rich context provided by smartphones has enabled many new context-aware applications. However, these applications still need to provide their own mechanisms to interpret low-level sensing data and generate high-level user states. In this paper, we propose the idea of building a personal analytics (PA) layer that will use inputs from multiple lower layer sources, such as sensor data (accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.), phone data (call logs, application activity, etc.), and online sources (Twitter, Facebook posts, etc.) to generate high-level user contextual states (such as emotions, preferences, and engagements). Developers can then use the PA layer to easily build a new set of interesting and compelling applications. We describe several scenarios enabled by this new layer and present a proposed software architecture. We end with a description of some of the key research challenges that need to be solved to …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Real-world deployments of WiFi-based indoor localization in large public venues are few and far between as most state-of-the-art solutions require either client or infrastructure-side changes. Hence, even though high location accuracy is possible with these solutions, they are not practical due to cost and/or client adoption reasons. Majority of the public venues use commercial controller-managed WLAN solutions, that neither allow client changes nor infrastructure changes. In fact, for such venues we have observed highly heterogeneous devices with very low adoption rates for client-side apps."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we propose a cheap and effective solution to detect if specific seats at a shared public table are occupied--either by humans or by objects (ie, the seats are being"" hogged""). The hogging of seats, in particular, is a big problem for our campus library and required a large amount of manpower to correct (to find and clear hogged seats). We propose using two different cheap sensors, a capacitance sensor and an infrared (IR) sensor, to solve this problem. In the rest of this paper, we show how using these sensors can accurately determine if a seat is occupied by a human or empty. We then show that the capacitance sensor can also accurately distinguish between three different states; 1) seat is empty, 2) seat is occupied by a human, c) seat is empty, but table area at seat is occupied (by a book, laptop, etc. ie, it is possibly hogged)."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper provides a fog-based approach to solving the traffic light optimization problem which utilizes the Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) model. ATSC systems demand the ability to strictly reflect real-time traffic state. The proposed fog computing framework, namely FogFly, aligns with this requirement by its natures in location-awareness, low latency and affordability to the changes in traffic conditions. As traffic data is updated timely and processed at fog nodes deployed close to data sources (ie, vehicles at intersections) traffic light cycles can be optimized efficiently while virtualized resources available at network edges are efficiently utilized. Evaluation results show that services running in FogFly produce better performance comparing to those in cloud computing approaches."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Capsule endoscopy identifies damaged areas in a patient's small intestine but often outputs poor-quality images or misses lesions, leading to either misdiagnosis or repetition of the lengthy procedure. The authors propose applying deep-learning models to automatically process the captured images and identify lesions in real time, enabling the capsule to take additional images of a specific location, adjust its focus level, or improve image quality. The authors also describe the technical challenges in realizing a viable automated capsule-endoscopy system."

This article is part of a special issue on pervasive computing revisited."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we describe the progressive design of the gesture recognition module of an automated food journaling system--Annapurna. Annapurna runs on a smartwatch and utilises data from the inertial sensors to first identify eating gestures, and then captures food images which are presented to the user in the form of a food journal. We detail the lessons we learnt from multiple in-the-wild studies, and show how eating recognizer is refined to tackle challenges such as (i) high gestural diversity, and (ii) non-eating activities with similar gestural signatures. Annapurna is finally robust (identifying eating across a wide diversity in food content, eating styles and environments) and accurate (false-positive and false-negative rates of 6.5% and 3.3% respectively)"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Deep learning has revolutionized vision sensing applications in terms of accuracy comparing to other techniques. Its breakthrough comes from the ability to extract complex high level features directly from sensor data. However, deep learning models are still yet to be natively supported on mobile devices due to high computational requirements. In this paper, we present DeepMon, a next generation of DeepSense [1] framework, to enable deep learning models on conventional mobile devices (eg Samsung Galaxy S7) for continuous vision sensing applications. Firstly, Deep-Mon exploits similarity between consecutive video frames for intermediate data caching within models to enhance inference latency. Secondly, DeepMon leverages approximation technique (eg Tucker decomposition) to build up approximated models with negligible impact on accuracy. Thirdly, DeepMon offloads heavy computation onto …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"To enhance fleet operation and management, logistics companies instrument their vehicles with GPS receivers and network connectivity to servers. Mobility traces from such large fleets provide significant information on commuter travel patterns, traffic congestion and road anomalies, and hence several researchers have mined such datasets to gain useful urban insights. These logistics companies, however, incur significant cost in deploying and maintaining their vast network of instrumented vehicles. Thus research problems, that are not only of interest to urban planners, but to the logistics companies themselves are important to attract and engage these companies for collaborative data analysis."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Applications on the smartphones are able to capitalize on the increasingly advanced hardware to provide a user experience reasonably impressive. However, the advancement of these applications are hindered battery lifetime of the smartphones. The battery technologies have a relatively low growth rate. Applications like mobile multiplayer games are especially power hungry as they maximize the use of the network, display and CPU resources. The PGTP, presented in this paper is aware of both the transport requirement of these multiplayer mobile games and the limitation posed by battery resource. PGTP dynamically controls the transport based on the criticality of game state and the network state to save energy at the wireless network interface (WNIC) level with almost no degradation to the quality of the game play."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper presents a framework for engineering resource-adaptive software targeted at small mobile devices. Rather than building a solution from scratch, we extend and integrate existing work on software infrastructures for ubiquitous computing, and on resource-adaptive applications.This paper addresses two research questions: first, is it feasibility to coordinate resource allocation and adaptation policies among several applications in a way that is both effective and efficient. And second, can end-users understand and control such adaptive behaviors dynamically, depending on user-defined goals for each activity. The evaluation covered both the systems and the usability perspectives, the latter by means of a user study.The contributions of this work are: first, a set of design guidelines, including APIs for integrating new applications; second, a concrete infrastructure that implements the …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we reduce the energy overheads of continuous mobile sensing, specifically for the case of context-aware applications that are interested in collective context or events, i.e., events expressed as a set of complex predicates over sensor data from multiple smartphones. We propose a cloud-based query management and optimization framework, called CloQue, that can support thousands of such concurrent queries, executing over a large number of individual smartphones. Our central insight is that the context of different individuals & groups often have significant correlation, and that this correlation can be learned through standard association rule mining on historical data. CloQue’s exploits such correlation to reduce energy overheads via two key innovations: (i) dynamically reordering the order of predicate processing to preferentially select predicates with not just lower sensing cost and higher …"

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Addressing resource variation plays an increasingly important role in engineering today's software systems. Research in resource-adaptive applications takes an important step towards addressing this problem. However, existing solutions stop short of addressing the fact that different user tasks often have specific goals of quality of service, and that such goals often entail multiple aspects of quality of service. This paper presents a framework for engineering software systems capable of adapting to resource variations in ways that are specific to the quality goals of each user task. For that, users are empowered to specify their task-specific preferences with respect to multiple aspects of quality of service. Such preferences are then exploited to both coordinate resource usage across the applications supporting the task, and to dynamically control the resource adaptation polices of those applications. A user study validates that non-expert users can use this framework to successfully control the behavior of such adaptive systems."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present LpGL, an OpenGL API compatible Low-power Graphics Library for energy efficient AR headset applications. We first characterize the power consumption patterns of a state of the art AR headset, Magic Leap One, and empirically show that its internal GPU is the most impactful and controllable energy consumer. Based on the preliminary studies, we design LpGL so that it uses the device's gaze/head orientation information and geometry data to infer user perception information, intercepts application-level graphics API calls, and employs frame rate control, mesh simplification, and culling techniques to enhance energy efficiency of AR headsets without detriment of user experience. Results from a comprehen-sive set of controlled in-lab experiments and an IRB-approved user study with 25 participants show that LpGL reduces up to 22% of total energy usage while adding only 46 sec of latency per object …"

During the demo, users will be able to observe the power saving technique within a virtual world in two modes: fly-through and interactive."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of our system, which provides an engaging game-based pre-prosthesis training environment for upper limb transradial amputees. We believe that patients who train using such a training tool will demonstrate significantly higher improvement in functional performance tests using a myoelectric prosthesis than when conventional pre-prosthesis training protocols are used. We re-designed two simple games to be playable using three muscle contractions which are appropriate to pre-prosthesis exercises and are detected by an EMG-based arm sleeve. Through user studies conducted with 16 non-amputee subjects, we show that the proposed games are enjoyable, fun to play, sustains motivation to continue playing and also helps in improving muscular control. Using an HMM trained on EMG data collected from the game play sessions of each user, we are able to …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We consider the problem of excessive and unnecessary active scans in heavily utilized WLANs during which low rate probe requests and responses are broadcast. These management frames severely impact the goodput. Our analysis of two production WLANs reveals that lesser number of non-overlapping channels in  GHz makes it more prone to the effects of increased probe frames than  GHz. We find that not only up to % of probe responses carry redundant information but the probe traffic can be as high as \% of the management traffic. Furthermore, active scanning severely impacts real-time applications at a client as it increases the latency by  times. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of active scans on an individual client and the whole network. We discuss three ways to control the probe traffic in production WLANs -- access point configurations, network planning, and client modification. Our proposals for access point configuration are in line with current WLAN deployments, better network planning is device agnostic in nature, and client modification reduces the average number of probe requests per client by up to % without hampering the ongoing WiFi connection."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The emergence of augmented reality devices such as Google Glass and Microsoft Hololens has opened up a new class of vision sensing applications. Those applications often require the ability to continuously capture and analyze contextual information from video streams. They often adopt various deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve high recognition accuracy while facing severe challenges to run computationally intensive deep learning algorithms on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we propose and explore a new class of compression technique called D-Pruner to efficiently prune redundant parameters within a CNN model to run the model efficiently on mobile devices. D-Pruner removes redundancy by embedding a small additional network. This network evaluates the importance of filters and removes them during the fine-tuning phase to …"

In this work, we designed a practical system using wearable physiological sensors including skin electrical conductivity and photoplethysmography (PPG) to recognize popular non-negative emotions that people experience when they watch videos or play games on their mobile devices. We demonstrates how our system recognizes emotional states in two phases:(1) classifying the levels of arousal (high or low) and valence (positive or neutral) at the accuracy of 94.74% and 78.95% respectively;(2) recognizing three non-negative emotions: excitement, contentment, amusement by mapping arousal and valence levels using Russel circumplex model of affect."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper extends our recent work, called GameOn, which presented a system for allowing public transport commuters to engage in multiplayer games with fellow commuters traveling on the same bus or train. An important challenge for GameOn is to group players with reliable connections into the same game. In this case, the meaning of reliability has two dimensions. First, the network connectivity (TCP, UDP etc.) should be robust. Second, the players should be collocated with each other for a sufficiently long duration so that a game session will not be terminated by players leaving the public transport modality such as bus or train. In the GameOn paper, we focused on the first dimension while in this paper we describe detailed constraints and policies used by the matchmaker and discuss the influences of using GameOn on game design."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This work presents HeartQuake, a low cost, accurate, non-intrusive, geophone-based sensing system for extracting accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns using heartbeat vibrations that penetrate through a bed mattress. In HeartQuake, cardiac activity-originated vibration patterns are captured on a geophone and sent to a server, where the data is filtered to remove the sensor's internal noise and passed on to a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) deep learning model for ECG waveform estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution that can non-intrusively provide accurate ECG waveform characteristics instead of more basic abstract features such as the heart rate using bed-mounted geophone sensors. Our extensive experimental results with a baseline dataset collected from 21 study participants and a longitudinal dataset from 15 study participants suggest that HeartQuake, even …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present I 4 S, a system that identifies item interactions of customers in a retail store through sensor data fusion from smartwatches, smartphones and distributed BLE beacons. To identify these interactions, I 4 S builds a gesture-triggered pipeline that (a) detects the occurrence of"" item picks"", and (b) performs fine-grained localization of such pickup gestures. By analyzing data collected from 31 shoppers visiting a midsized stationary store, we show that we can identify person-independent picking gestures with a precision of over 88%, and identify the rack from where the pick occurred with 91%+ precision (for popular racks)."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"With app-based interaction increasingly permeating all aspects of daily living, it is essential to ensure that apps are designed to be inclusive and are usable by a wider audience such as the elderly, with various impairments (eg, visual, audio and motor). We propose Empath-D, a system that fosters empathetic design, by allowing app designers, in-situ, to rapidly evaluate the usability of their apps, from the perspective of impaired users. To provide a truly authentic experience, Empath-D carefully orchestrates the interaction between a smartphone and a VR device, allowing the user to experience simulated impairments in a virtual world while interacting naturally with the app, using a real smartphone. By carefully orchestrating the VR-smartphone interaction, Empath-D tackles challenges such as preserving low-latency app interaction, accurate visualization of hand movement and low-overhead perturbation of I/O …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper aims to develop a system that evaluates the emotional experience of gamers based on physiological changes. A within-subject experiment with 22 participants has been designed to investigate the effects of difficulty level and social playing mode on player emotions and to examine the correlation between each emotion and the physiological changes. We demonstrate the feasibility of using commodity wearable physiological sensing devices to recognize mobile gamer's emotion. Specifically, our system performs 3-level excitement classification at an accuracy of 77.38% and binary classification of happiness state at an accuracy of 73.21%. These classification results show the potential of using commodity wearable sensing devices as a valuable evaluation tool for game designers to gauge user emotions and develop personalized gaming experience."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In the current retail segment, the retail store owners are keen to understand the browsing behavior and purchase pattern of the shoppers inside the physical stores.

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Fine-grained, unobtrusive monitoring of gym exercises can help users track their own exercise routines and also provide corrective feedback. We propose W8-Scope, a system that uses a simple magnetic-cum-accelerometer sensor, mounted on the weight stack of gym exercise machines, to infer various attributes of gym exercise behavior. More specifically, using multiple machine learning models, W8-Scope helps identify who is exercising, what exercise she is doing, how much weight she is lifting, and whether she is committing any common mistakes. Real world studies, conducted with 50 subjects performing 14 different exercises over 103 distinct sessions in two gyms, show that W8-Scope can, at the granularity of individual exercise sets, achieve high accuracy—e.g., identify the weight used with an accuracy of 97.5%, detect commonplace mistakes with 96.7% accuracy and identify the user with 98.7% accuracy …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We live in a world in which our physical spaces are becoming increasingly enriched with computing technology. Pervasive displays have been at the forefront of this progression and are now commonplace. In this paper, we focus on the natural end-point of this trend and consider the case when displays become truly ubiquitous and saturate our physical environments. We use as motivation a state-of-the-art display deployment in which mobile users navigating the space are simultaneously exposed to many hundreds of displays within their field of view and we highlight a number of new research challenges."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals offer rich information for analyzing and understanding the cardiac activity of a person. The continuous monitoring of ECG can help diagnose cardiac disorders, such as arrhythmia, effectively. While many wearable healthcare platforms offer continuous ECG monitoring, these devices are cumbersome in the fact that they need to be continuously attached to the human body, which causes uncomfortableness, and limits their usage when monitoring a person's ECG throughout the night as they sleep. In this work, we propose a fully non-intrusive sensing system for monitoring the ECG of a person while in bed. Specifically, we present Heartquake, a geophone-based sensing system for extracting ECG patterns using heartbeat vibrations that penetrate through the mattress. The cardiac activity-originated vibration patterns are captured on the geophone and sent to a server, where the data is …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Can cryptocurrency mining (crypto-mining) be a practical ad-free monetization approach for mobile app developers? We conducted a lab experiment and a user study with 228 real Android users to investigate different aspects of mobile crypto-mining. In particular, we show that mobile devices have computational resources to spare and that these can be utilized for crypto-mining with minimal impact on the mobile user experience. We also examined the profitability of mobile crypto-mining and its stability as compared to mobile advertising. In many cases, the profit of mining can exceed mobile advertising's. Most importantly, our study shows that the majority (72%) of the participants are willing to allow crypto-mining as means to replace ads to trade-off for benefits such as a better user experience."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We espouse the vision of a smart object/campus architecture where sensors attached to smart objects use BLE as communication interface, and where smartphones act as opportunistic relays to transfer the data. We explore the feasibility of the vision with real-world Wi-Fi based location traces from our university campus. Our feasibility studies establish that redundancy exists in user movement within the indoor spaces, and that this redundancy can be exploited for collecting sensor data in an opportunistic, yet fair manner. We develop a couple of alternative heuristics that address the BLE energy asymmetry challenge by intelligently duty-cycling the scanning actions of individual devices. We evaluate the efficacy and tradeoffs of the proposed approaches by simulation experiments with real-world location traces."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We describe our vision for Empath-D, our system to enable Empathetic User Interface Design. Our key idea is to leverage Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) displays to provide an Immersive Reality environment, where developers/designers can emulate impaired interactions by elderly or disabled users while testing the usability of their applications. Our early experiences with the Empath-D prototype show that Empath-D can emulate a cataract vision impairment of the elderly and guide designers to create accessible web pages with less mental workload."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The wide spread use of smart phones has ushered in a wave of context-based advertising services that operate on pre-defined user events. A prime example is Location Based Advertising. What is missing though, is the ability to experiment with these services under varying event conditions with real users using their regular phones in real-world environments. Such experiments provide greater insight into user needs for and responsiveness towards context-based advertising applications. However, these event-driven experiments rely on data that arrive from sources such as mobile sensors which have inherent uncertainties associated with them. This effects the interpretation of the outcome of an experiment. In this paper we introduce Jarvis, a behavioural experimentation platform that supports running in-situ real-time experiments of mobile advertising services, targeting real participants on their smart phones …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"A common problem in large urban cities is the huge number of retail options available. In response, a number of shopping assistance applications have been created for mobile phones. However, these applications mostly allow users to know where stores are or find promotions on specific items. What is missing is a system that factors in a user's shopping preferences and automatically tells them which stores are of their interest. A key challenge in this system is building a matching algorithm that can combine user preferences with fairly unstructured deals and store information to generate a final rank ordered list. In this work, we present the first prototype of my Deal, a system that automatically ranks deals according to user preferences and presents them to the user on their mobile device."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We demonstrate our Mobile Forensics approach and leakcause identification system. Privacy protection on mobile applications is a serious concern with the increased proliferation of mobile devices. Most current leak detection tools only report on the occurrence of leaked private data, but provide inadequate information about the causes of the leaks to end-users. The goal of Mobile Forensics is to correlate user actions to privacy leaks, and to provide user-centric notifications. We utilize visual overlays on Android screen-captures for user warning. We believe that such Mobile Forensics is a promising way to be deployed in a large scale in the near future for privacy protection."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Many of the basic parameters of a ubiquitous computing environment are highly variable. For example, rate of mobility, quality of wireless communication, density of communicating nodes, power constraints and computational constraints all vary greatly from situation to situation. Unfortunately, existing routing protocols, transport protocols and adaptive applications can only adapt in a limited way. One feature that is missing from many systems is the ability to identify gross operating conditions and take on very different modes of operation. Such adaptability would improve the efficiency of many solutions. We use the term multi-modal protocols to describe systems that adapt in this way. We have explored two such systems: Wireless TCP and Overlay Routing."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"There has been a proliferation of multimedia traffic over the Internet in the last few years. More and more applications are using multimedia to enhance their presentations. These enhancements can take the form of pictures, movies and even audio clips embedded into the applications. However these multimedia enhancements tend to be fairly large in size and hence require a fairly large amount of network bandwidth if they are to be streamed over a network effectively. This bandwidth is necessary otherwise the quality of the multimedia application drops drastically. As such, more and more bandwidth on networks is being segregated for use by multimedia traffic and their corresponding applications. These applications include video conferencing, IP Telephony, Real Audio, and Net Casting.This proliferation of multimedia applications involving voice and video is straining the capacity of the Internet. The evolution and deployment of new network technologies involving the provision of bandwidth has continually fed the insatiable end user’s appetite for even more bandwidth. Whenever a leap in network technology for provisioning bandwidth occurs, the end user demands for bandwidth threatens to consume the available capacity and stress the limits of technology. In addition, the increasing use of TCP [22, 29, 51, 53] unfriendly and unresponsive flows compounds the problem of tackling congestion on the Internet."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Understanding individual's exercise motives, participation patterns in a gym and reasons for dropout are essential for designing strategies to help gym-goers with long-term exercise adherence. In this work, we derive insights on various exercise-related behaviors of gym-goers, including evidence of a significant number of individuals exhibiting early dropout and also describing their attitudes towards digital technologies for sustained gym participation. By utilizing gym visitation data logs of 6513 individuals over a longitudinal period of 16 months in a campus gym, we show the retention and dropout rates of gym-goers. Our data indicates that 32% of the people quit their gym activity after initial 1 or 2 visits and about 65% of the users have less than 10 visits during the 16 months period. From this data, we also observed that people attending gym in a group and following a regular visiting time to the gym have a lower …"

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The Massively Multiplayer Game (MMOG) market, exemplified by games such as World of Warcraft, is a substantial and rapidly growing subsegment of the multibillion dollar Multiplayer Online Game (MOG) industry. A key challenge in MOGs is providing real time response latencies to the large number of concurrent game players. This has attracted substantial commercial and research attention, resulting in widely used methods such as deadreckoning and local-lag. The problem with scaling these approaches is well known however, and it is widely accepted that they simply will not work in the scale required for MMOGs. In this paper, we suggest a variety of ways to manage consistency in MMOGs with the objective of providing desired latency levels while still ensuring that every player has a “good-enough” view of their game environment. The contribution of this paper is in presenting a family of consistency protocols for MMOGs that address two key challenges:(1) when an event occurs, how do we figure out the set of clients that need to be informed of this event?, and (2) how do we schedule the dissemination of updates to clients such that latencies and consistency requirements are satisfied? We show, through analytical methods and simulations, that our protocols are (a)“optimal” in computing the set of clients that need to be informed of an event, and (b) that they can scale to a large number of clients while still satisfying all latency and consistency requirements."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Programmable network processors such as Intel's IXP1200 promise easy extendibility and high performance. In this work, we present an evaluation of the IXP1200 from a computer architect's point of view. We determine metrics like average number of instructions in ight, IPC, and branch mispredictions. In addition, we investigate memory bus bandwidth and memory access latencies. We show that the IXP1200 is able to achieve high IPC numbers due to its hardware support for multiple threads. This feature also allows it to hide the relatively high latencies for accessing memory."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Material identification and target imaging play an important role in many applications. This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commodity Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) devices. The key intuition is that different materials and/or target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes, when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system, including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target; (ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Much research argues that feeling overwhelmed by stress and for prolonged periods can lead to severe mental illness such as early onset depression and anxiety among many others. Recovering from severe stress to a normal state is much easier, in terms of the length of time and treatment required, compared to when more serious conditions have manifested [1]. Unfortunately, existing stress monitoring applications either require dedicated applications to be installed on the user's mobile device or use various mobile and wearable sensors [2, 4, 6, 7]; thus are not scalable to large number of users. Our goal is to provide a community-wide"" safety net"" that will automatically and non-intrusively detect individuals exhibiting signs of excessive stress without them installing any dedicated app. YouTube Demo Link https://youtu. be/LKQvIX4W6L0"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Much research argues the importance of supporting social interactions in teams and communities. The field of mobile sensing alone offers significant advances in recording and understanding human and group behaviours. However, little is known about behavioural changes as a consequence of in-group phenomena. One prominent example is intra-group conflict, which naturally arises between diverse groups of people. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to extract mobility patterns of individual's group behaviours sensed from a WiFi indoor localisation system and explore how these patterns relate to their team processes. 62 students enrolled in a project-intensive module, Software Engineering, were tracked over 81 days. Preliminary analysis of mobility patterns and interview data revealed differences in the mobility patterns of individuals based on their experience of conflict."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Understanding emotions of gamers can benefit game designers in various ways. How gamers feel while they playing a game can be treated as valuable user feedback to improve the development process of that game. Sensing player emotions also enables game designers to create adaptive game that can adjust itself to provide best gaming experience based on player emotions. However, how to effectively evaluate emotions of gamers is still an open research challenge. Two common techniques to evaluate emotional state are using self-assessments such as questionnaires or interviews, and to recognize expressed emotions by analyzing videos or images of facial expression, body languages, and gesture. Although the self-report approach is convenient and unobtrusive, it requires users’ cognitive attention. The vision-based approach also has some drawbacks that users’ expressions do not necessarily reflect …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Monitoring an individual’s daily dietary intake can provide various insights regarding the health of the individual. Applications such as [1] exists, which allows individuals to monitor all items that the individual consumed. However, manual monitoring can be labour intensive. To overcome this limitation, wrist worn sensor based eating habit monitoring has been studied by various researchers [2, 3]. These systems can detect eating gesture, but they cannot determine what is being eaten. We have built a system which can (i) detect eating gesture using the smartwatch’s inertial sensors (ii) use the smartwatch’s camera to capture images of food consumed at opportune moment and (iii) present the images to the user at the end of day [4]. Key challenges in building the system are:(i) limited battery (ii) diversity in eating style and (iii) latency in camera triggering."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Detecting the group context of an individual (ie, whether an individual is alone or part of a group) in crowded public spaces, such as shopping malls, is an important goal with many practical applications. However, in crowded indoor spaces, understanding the group-dependent movement behavior is a non-trivial problem as:(1) detecting groups is hard as the density ensures that at any location, a large number of people are moving together,(2) location tracking in many real-world venues is either absent or not very accurate, and (3) indoor mobility models that take into account group attributes (such as group size) are rare. In this paper, we first introduce GruMon, a platform for near real-time group monitoring in dense, public spaces, and then demonstrate how the movement & residency properties of individuals are significantly affected when they are in groups."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Profiling or fingerprinting human behavior has been widely used in context-aware and security applications. In this paper, we present a new way of generating behavioral (not biometric) fingerprints from the usage data of cellphone users. In particular, in this paper we explore if the generated behavioral fingerprints are memorable enough to be remembered by end users. One obvious application of memorable fingerprints is in authenticating users who are not technically proficient. Memorable fingerprints can be used to generate authentication questions that anyone can answer without memorizing or needing any physical device. We built a system, called HuMan, that generates fingerprints from cellphone data. To test HuMan, we conducted an extensive user study that involved collecting about one month of continuous usage data (including calls, SMSes, application usage patterns etc.) from 58 Symbian and …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We will demo Focus, a system for effectively and efficiently reducing the power consumption on mobile devices with OLED displays. Focus uses the notion of saliency to reduce display power by dimming the parts of an application or game that are of lower interest [2]. Our measurement results, performed using the Monsoon hardware power measurement tool, shows that Focus can save, on average, between 23 and 35% of the OLED display power when applications are used. In the demo, we will allow users to use Focus with 6 different applications running on a Galaxy SIII phone. During the demo, users will be able to configure Focus for any of the 6 applications and then see the effect on the usability and power consumption of the resulting system."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we study the decision making process involved in the five year lifecycle of a Bluetooth software product produced by a large, multi-national test and measurement firm. In this environment, customer change requests either have to be added as a standard feature in the product, or developed as a special customized version of the product. We first discuss the influential factors, such as evolving standards, market share, installed-base, and complexity, which collectively determined how the firm responded to product change requests. We then develop a predictive decision model to test the collective impact of these factors on determining whether to standardize or customize a customer's change request. Finally, we develop and test a customization cost estimation model, for use by software product teams, which specifically accounts for factors unique to the customization stage of a product lifecycle."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"With the prevalance of handheld devices, it is increasingly necessary to build systems that adapt applications according to the available resources. These systems offer new and constantly changing interfaces for adaptation. Integrating applications with these systems requires extensive modification and maintainence: this is painful! In this paper, we present an approach that allows application writers to easily integrate their applications with an adaptive runtime system. This approach involves the use of a high level description language coupled with a runtime-specific stub generator. We present two case studies of enhancing applications for adaptation using our approach. Our case studies show that our approach is viable and can help to ease the integration of applications into adaptive runtime systems."

In this paper, we introduce the research questions raised by cyber foraging and outline our work in developing staging servers and remote execution mechanisms using surogates to improve the performance of mobile devices."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Social identification: how much individuals psychologically associate themselves with a group has been posited as an essential construct to measure individual and group dynamics. Studies have shown that individuals who identify very differently from their workgroup provide critical cues to the lack of social support or work overloads. However, measuring identification is typically achieved through time-consuming and privacy-invasive surveys. We hypothesize that the extremities in-group norm affects individuals' behaviors, thus more likely to give rise to negative appraisals. As a more convenient and less-invasive technique, we propose a method to predict individuals who are increasingly different in identifying themselves with their working peers using mobility data passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. To test our hypothesis, we collected WiFi data of 62 college students over a whole semester. Students …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Sleep deprivation is a public health concern that significantly impacts one's well-being and performance. Sleep is an intimate experience, and state-of-the-art sleep monitoring solutions are highly-personalized to individual users. With a motivation to expand sleep monitoring at a large-scale and contribute sleep data to public health understanding, we present WiSleep, a sleep monitoring and analytics platform using smartphone network connections that are passively sensed from WiFi infrastructure. We propose an unsupervised ensemble model of Bayesian change point detection to predict sleep and wake-up times. Then, we validate our approach using ground truth from a user study in campus dormitories and a private home. Our results find WiSleep outperforming established methods for users with irregular sleep patterns while yielding comparable accuracy for regular sleepers with an average 79.5\% accuracy. This is comparable to client-side based methods, albeit utilizing only coarse-grained information. Finally, we show that WiSleep can process data from 20,000 users on a single commodity server, allowing it to scale to large campus populations with low server requirements."

Our experimental results with 21study participants suggest that Heartquake can detect all five ECG peaks (eg, P, Q, R, S, T) with an average error of as low as 16 msec when participants are stationary on the bed. With additional noise factors, this error shows an increase, but can be mitigated from model personalization to still be sufficient enough as a screening tool to detect urgent situations."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Today, deep learning algorithms have been widely adopted to boost up accuracy of vision-sensing applications. For instances, developers can capture first-person-view images from smart glasses and leverage face recognition algorithm based on deep learning to remind user about the names of people in a large party.Deep learning algorithms, however, also incur high computational requirements and energy consumption on executing devices which is not suitable for resource-constraint devices such as smartphones. Conventional approach to address this problem is to offload computation onto cloud servers. However, this approach might contain threats to users such as privacy concerns. For instances, vision-based face recognition applications may expose private information of users such as their identities, locations and current activities. In this demo, we show that it is feasible to execute CNN for vision sensing …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Smartwatches complement the main mobile phone and are able to profile user-activity as well as provide links, updates and notifications with work or personal utilities (eg Email, Social Media, Messaging etc.). Although very promising, smartwatches are still limited by low battery life. This is due to the small size of the battery as well as the need to continuously perform sensing. Battery drain issues by apps as well as the system are a common complaint by users. Improved tools for power analysis and profiling of smartwatch apps can help both developers (by providing a platform for prerelease analysis) and users (by advising them on app characteristics prior to installation)."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"While automated testing of mobile applications is very useful for checking run-time behaviours and specifications, its capability in discovering issues in apps is often limited in practice due to long testing time. A common practice is to randomly and exhaustively explore the whole app test space, which takes a lot of time and resource to achieve good coverage and reach targeted parts of the apps.In this paper, we present MAMBA1, a directed testing system for checking privacy in Android apps. MAMBA performs path searches of user events in control-flow graphs of callbacks generated from static analysis of app bytecode. Based on the paths found, it builds test cases comprised of user events that can trigger the executions of the apps and quickly direct the apps’ activity transitions from the starting activity towards target activities of interest, revealing potential accesses to privacy-sensitive data in the apps. MAMBA’s …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"While mobile platforms rely on developers to follow good practices in privacy design, developers might not always adhere. In addition, it is often difficult for users to understand the privacy behaviour of their applications without some prolonged usage. To aid in these issues, we describe on-going research to improve privacy protection by utilizing techniques that mine privacy information from application binaries as a grey-box (Automated Privacy Checking). The outputs can then be utilized to improve the users' ability to exercise privacy-motivated discretion. We conducted a user study to observe the effects of presenting information on leak-causing triggers within applications in the form of privacy message overlays. We found that while users' prior usage time largely determined their usage behaviour, presenting trigger information helped users who disapproved with data use and had sufficient understanding of the implications of data leaks. Users' inherent level of privacy consciousness and surprise levels were also factors in ensuring the effectiveness of messages."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In the public studying space, students sometimes hog seats. This behavior prevents others from access their needed seats, and requires man power to patrol and move stuffs from hogged seats to another place. In this paper, we present a capacitive sensor to check seat occupancy statuses in real-time (ie un-occupied, people occupying, and seat hogging). The device helps students to find available seats, and helps staffs to monitor seats usage remotely for better controlling over seat hogging problem without the need to patrol. Our experiment results show that the sensor can accurately detect seat occupancy. Moreover, it can clearly distinguish between human occupancy and seat hogging."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Mobile sensing applications have been increasingly popular. Even after many years of research, their power consumption and processing latency are still critical concerns. The problem gets aggravated especially when applications adopt complicated machine learning algorithms (eg, GMM, HMM, Neural network) over high-rate sensor streams like sound and video. In this paper, we aim at addressing the problem using mobile GPUs, which is recently integrated into state-of-the-art smartphones. We first studied if GPUs are more power-efficient and faster compared to CPUs under four different workloads (median filter, matrix multiplication, fast Fourier transform and Viterbi algorithm). Based on our measurements, we developed a simple task dispatcher that intelligently offloads various tasks from CPU to GPU, and showed the effectiveness of the dispatcher."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we reduce the energy overheads of continuous mobile sensing for context-aware applications that are interested in collective context or events. We propose a cloudbased query management and optimization framework, called CloQue, which can support concurrent queries, executing over thousands of individual smartphones. CloQue exploits correlation across context of different users to reduce energy overheads via two key innovations: i) dynamically reordering the order of predicate processing to preferentially select predicates with not just lower sensing cost and higher selectivity, but that maximally reduce the uncertainty about other context predicates; and ii) intelligently propagating the query evaluation results to dynamically update the uncertainty of other correlated, but yetto-be evaluated, context predicates. An evaluation, using real cellphone traces from a real world dataset shows significant …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"LiveLabs is an urban scale research testbed in Singapore. It is currently in the process of design, implementation and deployment at real-life urban spaces like a sprawling university campus, a shopping mall, an airport and an amusement park; where real smartphone users are being incentivized to participate in large scale consumer behavioral trials and experiments. The scale of the testbed needs careful research on multiple aspects of mobile computing - including smart application and UI design, smartphone power management, handling user privacy and so on. In this demonstration paper, we outline some important aspects of ongoing research, for handling some key technical challenges of a real city-scale smartphone testbed."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Detecting the group context of an individual (ie, whether an individual is alone or part of a group) in crowded public spaces, such as shopping malls, is an important goal with many practical applications. However, in crowded indoor spaces, understanding the group-dependent movement behavior is a non-trivial problem as:(1) detecting groups is hard as the density ensures that at any location, a large number of people are moving together,(2) location tracking in many real-world venues is either absent or not very accurate, and (3) indoor mobility models that take into account group attributes (such as group size) are rare. In this paper, we first introduce GruMon, a platform for near real-time group monitoring in dense, public spaces, and then demonstrate how the movement & residency properties of individuals are significantly affected when they are in groups."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Location has emerged as the single-most important context whilst building pervasive mobile applications. Several mobile applications have appeared that use location to provide a host of services such as location-specific advertising as well as navigation. As a result, the key challenge of positioning techniques has been to provide the most precise location of the user (device) and much effort has been put in computing this fine grained location in indoor environments. This is under the assumption that highly accurate location is crucial for all indoor services. To understand the location accuracy, that should prove sufficient, for users to navigate to a specific store in a mall, we conducted a user study that mimicked the mall-like setting in two university buildings. Our results suggest that for navigating indoors in mall-like settings, users do not require highly accurate location awareness."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this demo, we present Focus , a system for effectively and efficiently reducing the power consumption of OLED displays. The key idea of Focus is that we can save display power by dimming the portions of the applications and games that are less important to the user using the notion of saliency. We explain the design considerations driving Focus followed by a description of the implementation and demo of Focus to support both Android applications and games. Focus can save, on average, between 23 and 35% of the OLED display power when applications are used."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"As computing technologies become more pervasive, many new forms of mobility will emerge, with corresponding changes in people's transport behavior. The last few years have revealed indicators of these changes. For example, checking road conditions or train timings while commuting between work and home has become common practice. The growing availability of computing, sensing, and communication technologies, coupled with the opportunities that lie ahead, prompted this special issue on pervasive computing in transit and transport. The three articles in this issue cover just a small part of the entire research space but should inspire you to imagine new ways in which computing can affect transportation."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"To enhance fleet operation and management, logistics companies instrument their vehicles with GPS receivers and network connectivity to servers. Mobility traces from such large fleets provide significant information on commuter travel patterns, traffic congestion and road anomalies, and hence several researchers have mined such datasets to gain useful urban insights. These logistics companies, however, incur significant cost in deploying and maintaining their vast network of instrumented vehicles. Thus research problems, that are not only of interest to urban planners, but to the logistics companies themselves are important to attract and engage these companies for collaborative data analysis. In this paper, we show how GPS traces from taxis can be used to answer three different questions that are of great interest to a taxi operator. These questions are 1) What is the occupancy rate of the taxi fleet?, 2) What is …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Privacy protection against mobile applications on mobile devices is becoming a serious concern as user sensitive data may be leaked without proper justification. Most current leak detection tools only report leaked private data, but provide inadequate information about the causes of the leaks for end users to take preventive measures. Hence, users often cannot reconcile the way they have used an application to a reported leak—ie, they are unable to comprehend the (il) legitimacy of the leak or make a decision on whether to allow the leak. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of identifying the causes of leaks from a user’s point of view, which we call mobile forensics of privacy leaks. Its goal is to correlate user actions to leaks, and report the causes from a user-oriented perspective. To make the case, we have performed a preliminary study that identifies leak causes based on logs of user actions in more than 220 Android applications and corresponding leak reports from a leak detection tool. Our results show that more than 60% of the 105 applications (of the 220 we sampled) that leak private data leak data do so due to user actions on certain in-application GUI widgets. About 44% also leak data right after users launch them, while 32% leak data periodically after launch. We also constructed a database containing leak causes from all tested apps, and demonstrated the use of visual overlays to warn users about potential leaks."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"A common problem in large Urban cities, of the sort seen in Asia, is the huge number of retail options available in the city. In particular, it is not uncommon to find multiple malls, each with hundreds of stores inside, just a short distance from each other in almost every part of these cities. These factors make it incredibly hard for consumers to identify stores of interest to them in any particular mall. In response, a number of shopping assistance applications have been created for mobile phones. However, these applications mostly just allow users to know which stores are where or to find promotions on specific items. What is missing is a system that factors in a user’s shopping preferences and automatically tells them which stores are most likely to capture their interest. The key challenge in this system is twofold; 1) building a matching algorithm that can combine user preferences with fairly unstructured deals and store information to generate a final rank ordered list, and 2) designing a mobile user interface that can display a large amount of deal and shopping information to the user in an easy intuitive way."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we examined the impact of project-level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity, quality, and profits. Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profitoriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We present the results of a three year field study of the software development process choices made by project teams at two leading offshore vendors. In particular, we focus on the performance implications of project teams that chose to augment structured, plan-driven processes to implement the CMM level-5 Key Process Areas (KPAs) with agile methods. Our analysis of 112 software projects reveals that the decision to augment the firm-recommended, plandriven approach with improvised, agile methods was significantly affected by the extent of client knowledge and involvement, the newness of technology, and the project size. Furthermore this decision had a significant and mostly positive impact on project performance indicators such as reuse, rework, defect density, and productivity."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Current mobile devices embrace a wide range of functionalities including high speed network support, hardware accelerated 3D graphics, and multimedia capabilities. These capabilities have boosted the interest for enabling multiplayer online games (MOG) support on such devices. However, the lack of similar growth in battery technology limits the usability of these devices for MOGs. In this paper, we present energy conservation techniques for highly interactive MOGs. These are games, such as first-person shooters, where crisp user interaction is paramount to the overall game experience. Hence, conserving energy while preserving crisp user interaction becomes a critical consideration in this domain. We first present three obvious power management approaches and highlight their limitations. We then discuss two application-assisted approaches for power management that manage to save power while preserving the required user experience. Our results demonstrate that these application-assisted approaches are very promising."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Dimorphic computing is a new model of computing that switches between thick and thin client modes of execution in a completely automated and transparent manner. It accomplishes this without imposing any language or structural requirements on applications. This model greatly improves the performance of applications that alternate between phases of compute-or data-intensive processing and intense user interaction. For such applications, the thin client mode allows efficient use of remote resources such as compute servers or large datasets. The thick client mode enables crisp interactive performance by eliminating the harmful effects of Internet latency and jitter, and by exploiting local graphical hardware acceleration. We demonstrate the feasibility and value of dimorphic computing through AgentISR, a prototype that exploits virtual machine technology. Experiments with AgentISR confirm that the performance of a number of widely-used scientific and graphic arts applications can be significantly improved without requiring any modification.This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant numbers CNS-0509004 and CCR-0205266, the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada under grant number 261545-3 and a Canada Graduate Scholarship, by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the Ontario Innovation Trust OIT) under grant number 7739.

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Mobile sensing has played a key role in providing digital solutions to aid with COVID-19 containment policies, primarily to automate contact tracing and social distancing measures. As more and more countries reopen from lockdowns, there remains a pressing need to minimize crowd movements and interactions, particularly in enclosed spaces. Many COVID-19 technology solutions leverage positioning systems, generally using Bluetooth and GPS, and can theoretically be adapted to monitor safety compliance within dedicated environments. However, they may not be the ideal modalities for indoor positioning. This paper conjectures that analyzing user occupancy and mobility via deployed WiFi infrastructure can help institutions monitor and maintain safety compliance according to the public health guidelines. Using smartphones as a proxy for user location, our analysis demonstrates how coarse-grained WiFi data …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we show how tone mapping techniques can be used to dynamically increase the image brightness, thus allowing the LCD backlight levels to be reduced. This saves significant power as the majority of the LCD’s display power is consumed by its backlight. The Gamma function (or equivalent) can be efficiently implemented in smartphones with minimal resource cost. We describe how we overcame the Gamma function’s non-linear nature by using adaptive thresholds to apply different Gamma values to images with differing brightness levels. These adaptive thresholds allow us to save significant amounts of power while preserving the image quality. We implemented our solution on a laptop and two Android smartphones. Finally, we present measured analytical results for two different games (Quake III and Planeshift), and user study results (using Quake III and 60 participants) that shows that we can save up to 68% of the display power without significantly affecting the perceived gameplay quality."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Fine-grained, unobtrusive monitoring of gym exercises can help users track their own exercise routines and also provide corrective feedback. We propose W8-Scope, a system that uses a simple magnetic-cum-accelerometer sensor, mounted on the weight stack of gym exercise machines, to infer various attributes of gym exercise behavior. More specifically, using multiple machine learning models, W8-Scope helps identify who is exercising, what exercise she is doing, how much weight she is lifting, and whether she is committing any common mistakes. Real world studies, conducted with 50 subjects performing 14 different exercises over 103 distinct sessions in two gyms, show that W8-Scope can, at the granularity of individual exercise sets, achieve high accuracy—eg, identify the weight used with an accuracy of 97.5%, detect commonplace mistakes with 96.7% accuracy and identify the user with 98.7% accuracy …"

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Monitoring an individual’s daily dietary intake can provide various insights regarding the health of the individual. Applications such as [1] exists, which allows individuals to monitor all items that the individual consumed. However, manual monitoring can be labour intensive. To overcome this limitation, wrist worn sensor based eating habit monitoring has been studied by various researchers [2, 3]. These systems can detect eating gesture, but they cannot determine what is being eaten. We have built a system which can (i) detect eating gesture using the smartwatch’s inertial sensors (ii) use the smartwatch’s camera to capture images of food consumed at opportune moment and (iii) present the images to the user at the end of day [4]. Key challenges in building the system are:(i) limited battery (ii) diversity in eating style and (iii) latency in camera triggering."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Smartwatches complement the main mobile phone and are able to profile user-activity as well as provide links, updates and notifications with work or personal utilities (eg Email, Social Media, Messaging etc.). Although very promising, smartwatches are still limited by low battery life. This is due to the small size of the battery as well as the need to continuously perform sensing. Battery drain issues by apps as well as the system are a common complaint by users. Improved tools for power analysis and profiling of smartwatch apps can help both developers (by providing a platform for prerelease analysis) and users (by advising them on app characteristics prior to installation)."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In the current retail segment, the retail store owners are keen to understand the browsing behavior and purchase pattern of the shoppers inside the physical stores. Profiling the behavior of the shopper is key to success for any marketing strategies that can optimize or personalize shopping-related services in real-time. We envision that exploiting the knowledge of real-time behavior of shopper’s in-store activities enables novel applications such as:(a) targeted advertising or recommendations: based on longer term shopper profiles,(b) proactive retail help to assist the shoppers who are confused in choosing between two items,(c) smart reminders that can remind the shoppers to pick up an item in the shopping list that they might have missed.Our work is motivated by the fact that a significant fraction of in-store shopping activities involve gestural interactions with objects of interest (such as picking up an item and putting the item in the shopping cart in a grocery store or retrieving and trying out a dress in a clothing store). In our recent works [1, 2], we showed the design and initial prototype of frameworks for reliably inferring shopper’s in-store interactions and behavior by just observing their hand and foot movement inside a store. The hand gestures and locomotive pattern of the shopper inside a store is identified by appropriately mining the sensor data from shopper’s personal smartphone and wearable devices (smartwatch). The key challenges in building such a system that automatically identifies the various shopping interactions requires us to (a) determine discriminative features that can identify the gestures,(b) reliably demarcate the (start, end …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"While mobile platforms rely on developers to follow good practices in privacy design, developers might not always adhere. In addition, it is often difficult for users to understand the privacy behaviour of their applications without some prolonged usage. To aid in these issues, we describe on-going research to improve privacy protection by utilizing techniques that mine privacy information from application binaries as a grey-box (Automated Privacy Checking). The outputs can then be utilized to improve the user’s ability to exercise privacy-motivated discretion. We conducted a user study to observe the effects of presenting information on leak-causing triggers within applications in the form of privacy message overlays. We found that while users’ prior usage time largely determined their usage behaviour, presenting trigger information helped users who disapproved with data use and had sufficient understanding of the implications of data leaks. Users’ inherent level of privacy consciousness and surprise levels were also factors in ensuring the effectiveness of messages."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Detecting occupancy of seats in library is important for librarians to check seats’ usage, and for students to find available seats in crowded time. In our prior work [1], we presented in-lab micro benchmarks to show feasibility of capacitive sensing for seat occupancy detection. In this demo paper, we present larger scale real-world deployment of occupancy detection system and its performance."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The rich context provided by smartphones has enabled many new context-aware applications. However, these applications still need to provide their own mechanisms to interpret low-level sensing data and generate high-level user states. In this paper, we propose the idea of building a personal analytics (PA) layer that will use inputs from multiple lower layer sources, such as sensor data (accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.), phone data (call logs, application activity, etc.), and online sources (Twitter, Facebook posts, etc.) to generate high-level user contextual states (such as emotions, preferences, and engagements). Developers can then use the PA layer to easily build a new set of interesting and compelling applications. We describe several scenarios enabled by this new layer and present a proposed software architecture. We end with a description of some of the key research challenges that need to be solved to achieve this goal."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Today, deep learning algorithms have been widely adopted to boost up accuracy of vision-sensing applications. For instances, developers can capture first-person-view images from smart glasses and leverage face recognition algorithm based on deep learning to remind user about the names of people in a large party.Deep learning algorithms, however, also incur high computational requirements and energy consumption on executing devices which is not suitable for resource-constraint devices such as smartphones. Conventional approach to address this problem is to offload computation onto cloud servers. However, this approach might contain threats to users such as privacy concerns. For instances, vision-based face recognition applications may expose private information of users such as their identities, locations and current activities. In this demo, we show that it is feasible to execute CNN for vision sensing tasks directly on mobile devices by leveraging integrated GPU. We propose our design of DeepSense framework based on OpenCL to execute deep learning algorithms in energy-efficient and fast manner."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of our system, which provides an engaging game-based pre-prosthesis training environment for upper limb transradial amputees. We believe that patients who train using such a training tool will demonstrate significantly higher improvement in functional performance tests using a myoelectric prosthesis than when conventional pre-prosthesis training protocols are used. We re-designed two simple games to be playable using three muscle contractions which are appropriate to pre-prosthesis exercises and are detected by an EMG-based arm sleeve. Through user studies conducted with 16 non-amputee subjects, we show that the proposed games are enjoyable, fun to play, sustains motivation to continue playing and also helps in improving muscular control. Using an HMM trained on EMG data collected from the game play sessions of each user, we are able to detect if the subject felt fatigued, while continuously contracting the muscles to play the game, in 93% of the cases and with a latency of only±15 seconds. We are also able to understand the subject’s quality of muscle isolation during the game play."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present I4S, a system that identifies item interactions of customers in a retail store through sensor data fusion from smartwatches, smartphones and distributed BLE beacons. To identify these interactions, I4S builds a gesture-triggered pipeline that (a) detects the occurrence of “item picks”, and (b) performs fine-grained localization of such pickup gestures. By analyzing data collected from 31 shoppers visiting a midsized stationary store, we show that we can identify personindependent picking gestures with a precision of over 88%, and identify the rack from where the pick occurred with 91%+ precision (for popular racks)."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"This paper provides a fog-based approach to solving the traffic light optimization problem which utilizes the Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) model. ATSC systems demand the ability to strictly reflect real-time traffic state. The proposed fog computing framework, namely FogFly, aligns with this requirement by its natures in location-awareness, low latency and affordability to the changes in traffic conditions. As traffic data is updated timely and processed at fog nodes deployed close to data sources (ie, vehicles at intersections) traffic light cycles can be optimized efficiently while virtualized resources available at network edges are efficiently utilized. Evaluation results show that services running in FogFly produce better performance comparing to those in cloud computing approaches."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"As the current generation of mobile smartphones become more powerful, they are being used to perform more resource intensive tasks making battery lifetime a major bottleneck. In this paper, we present a technique called dynamic AoV lookahead for reducing wireless interface power consumption upto 50% while playing a popular, yet resource intensive, mobile multiplayer games."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Mobile gaming has become increasingly popular in the past few years with the proliferation of smartphones that have the increased CPU, memory, and network (3.5 G etc.) capabilities to support a vast range of interesting games. In addition, these phones also have high quality displays, such as Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) displays, that allow the intricate details in games to be shown in vivid detail to end users. Unfortunately, these displays tend to consume a lot of energy–which in turn limits the amount of time that a user can spend actually playing games on these devices. In this paper, we describe a technique that makes use of saliency, with respect to the end user, to reduce the power consumption of OLED displays when they are used for games, by reducing the brightness of game areas that are not of interest currently to the game player. We evaluated our technique with a user study and showed that even for fast-paced shooting games, our solution is able to save a modest amount of power with no impact in the end user gaming experience."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In this paper, we present a new way of generating behavioral (not biometric) fingerprints from the cellphone usage data. In particular, we explore if the generated behavioral fingerprints are memorable enough to be remembered by end users. We built a system, called HuMan, that generates fingerprints from cellphone data. To test HuMan, we conducted an extensive user study that involved collecting about one month of continuous usage data (including calls, SMSes, application usage patterns etc.) from 44 Symbian and Android smartphone users. We evaluated the memorable fingerprints generated from this rich multi-context data by asking each user to answer various authentication questions generated from the fingerprints. Results show that the fingerprints generated by HuMan are remembered by the user to some extent and were moderately secure against attacks even by family members and close friends."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Advertisements are the de-facto currency of the Internet with many popular applications (eg Angry Birds) and online services (eg, YouTube) relying on advertisement generated revenue. However, the current economic models and mechanisms for mobile advertising are fundamentally not sustainable and far from ideal. In particular, as we show, applications which use mobile advertising are capable of using significant amounts of a mobile users’ critical resources without being controlled or held accountable. This paper seeks to redress this situation by enabling advertisement supported applications to become significantly more “userfriendly”. To this end, we present the design and implementation of CAMEO, a new framework for mobile advertising that 1) employs intelligent and proactive retrieval of advertisements, using context prediction, to significantly reduce the bandwidth and energy overheads of advertising, and 2) provides a negotiation protocol and framework that empowers applications to subsidize their data traffic costs by “bartering” their advertisement rights for access bandwidth from mobile ISPs. Our evaluation, that uses real mobile advertising data collected from around the globe, demonstrates that CAMEO effectively reduces the resource consumption caused by mobile advertising."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"WiFi clients discover APs in their vicinity with the process of active scanning during which they inject low bit-rate and high power probe traffic–the requests and the responses. We show that clients trigger these scans without considering a need for it; thereby consuming airtime and reducing network goodput. This problem prevalent in heavily utilized WLANs. In this work, we begin with analyzing the effects of unnecessary active scans on the client-side and the network-wide scale. We provide a metric to measure the growth of probe traffic. We analyze the causes that trigger such scans and provide a device-agnostic solution to infer these causes at the network-wide scale. Finally, we develop a client-agnostic solution to reduce the number of active scans, by disabling them when not required. All our results are based on production WLANs."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Multiplayer mobile games are an increasingly important class of mobile application. In our poster, we describe our overall system for optimizing the power and network characteristics of mobile devices during resource-intensive multiplayer game play. Our demo shows our prototype that identifies the current game action and uses that to tweak the power consumption of the mobile device. Our system is being designed to reduce the overall device power usage without sacrificing the end-user game experience."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Many of the basic parameters of a ubiquitous computing environment are highly variable. For example, rate of mobility, quality of wireless communication, density of communicating nodes, power constraints and computational constraints are all parameters that vary greatly from situation to situation. Unfortunately, existing routing protocols, transport protocols and adaptive applications can only adapt in a limited way. One feature that is missing from many systems is the ability to identify gross operating conditions and take on very different modes of operation. Such adaptability would improve the efficiency of many solutions. We use the term multi-modal protocols to describe systems that adapt in this way. We have explored 2 such systems; one that looks at wireless TCP and one that looks at overlay routing."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"We provide a demo of MAMBA, a system for fast and directed testing of Android applications. Currently, automated testing solutions exists for testing of mobile apps [1, 2]. While they are very useful for uncovering a variety of issues with mobile applications, ranging from bug-detection, checking of design specifications and privacy checking, current testers require that the entire search space of the application be tested. The commonly practiced solution is in increasing testing resources to comprehensively test the application to completion. We propose using an optimized graph of activity transitions from static analysis, to guide automated testing, so that testing specifications/requirements can be reached for quickly in a directed manner. Based on preliminary evaluations on test applications for privacy specifications, we find that a directed testing concept can reduce the testing time of applications from over a few hours …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"With the advent of smartphones, one has access to large amount of highly contextual data making possible several context aware services that weren't before. As a result customers are driving demand for context-enriched content derived from the nexus of information, social interactions, mobility and the cloud. Context-enriched content is nothing but the information, data and other content, ranging from articles to advertising to applications that is based on the user's context and is served to whatever media the recipient is using to interact with that content.As a result, the earlier push paradigm, wherein marketers would push print and electronic communications based on historical reference data to their customers and prospects has now been replaced. Today people want to pull information about a company's products and services that is valuable to them at that moment [5]. Whatever company they are interacting with has to react accordingly and immediately with content based on the recipient's context. The context here being, relevant facts about current conditions that are true in the moment but may not be in the future. Common examples include location, date and time, and other variable characteristics (the person is talking on a phone, visiting a website using a tablet, communicating via instant message, and so on)."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Indoor localization has been a particularly active area of research in the last few years. Many solutions have been proposed. Among those, RF-based approaches [1][2][3] received more attention since it is easy to implement and has relatively high accuracy. In this demo, we take a step back and to show that even with these many solutions proposed in the last few years, indoor localization is still a hard problem. We draw this conclusion from results by our recent efforts to provide a practical indoor location system at three different dense (ie, they have large numbers of people in a very small area) public urban environments; 1) our university campus, 2) a large shopping mall, and 3), an airport. In particular, we find that the heterogeneity, power management mode, density of people in an environment, and even the relative placement of devices can have significant impacts on the RSSI values observed by the devices. This in turn can significantly affect the accuracy of localization algorithms causing errors of multiple landmark distances. Figure 1 and Figure. 2 show some of the results. In Figure 1, we see the result of RSS measured by similar devices from the same location at very similar times. Figure 2 shows another interesting result that the RSS value switched completely with the low device becoming high for phone and vice versa while in dongle case."

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"Remote execution can transform the puniest mobile device into a computing giant. This would enable resourceintensive applications such as natural language translation, speech recognition, face recognition, and augmented reality to be run on tiny handheld, wearable or body-implanted platforms. Nearby compute servers, connected through a lowlatency wireless LAN, can provide the CPU cycles, memory, and energy needed for such applications. Unfortunately, two annoying facts cloud this rosy future. First, the partitioning of an interactive application into local and remote components that achieves good application performance is highly application-specific and platformspecific. Since mobile hardware evolves rapidly, this partitioning changes on the timescale of months rather than years. Incorrect partitioning can result in sluggish and intolerable interactive response. Hence, a tight and ongoing coupling between application developers and hardware platform developers appears inevitable. Second, matters are made worse by the fact that mobile environments exhibit highly variable resource availability. Bandwidth, energy and availability of compute servers can change on the timescale of minutes or hours, as a user moves to different locations. Re-partitioning an application for changed operating conditions at this timescale is therefore essential. These considerations suggest that an automated approach to partitioning applications for remote execution is necessary. However, partitioning an application automatically may result in bad performance if the intrinsic nature of the application is not factored into the partitioning decision.Another factor …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"My research philosophy revolves around the belief that successful systems research has to demonstrate two things: 1) a novel and interesting approach to an important research problem, and 2) usability. I strongly believe that for a system to be successful, it has to be usable by the target audience. On the other hand, a highly usable system that doesn’t advance the state of the art in any way is not particularly interesting from a research perspective either. My research style is strongly systems-oriented with a large emphasis on hands-on system implementation. A real implementation is crucial, in my opinion, for testing complicated distributed systems as the complexity inherent in these systems is incredibly hard to capture by simulation studies alone. A real implementation is also vital in validating the usability of the system. In addition, the software artifacts from such implementations are important contributions that drive future research and even product development in the area. I am also a strong proponent of collaborative research. Modern systems are so complicated that it is impossible for one person to have all the answers to every problem encountered. As such, I tend to work with about 2-4 other people, each with slightly different skills and backgrounds, to tackle a large systems problem.This philosophy and style is evident in all the research projects I have been involved with. For example, my thesis uses a novel insight, called tactics, to build a powerful remote execution system, called Chroma, for mobile devices. Chroma uses remote execution to allow large applications to run on limited mobile devices and I conducted numerous experiments …"
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"In a pervasive environment, the users are mobile; the devices that they carry are often small and limited in resources. Therefore, the applications that run on them benefit greatly by taking advantage of the computing infrastructure of the environment through adaptation and remote execution. Systems exist today that provide support for such adaptation. However, developing such an adaptive application is a challenging task due to the lack of a well-defined method to describe the adaptive behavior of the application as well as an API to interface with the operating system support. In this work, we present a language that concisely captures the application’s behavior and an API that truly provides an abstract interface to the operating system."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"The designers of mobile computing devices face a never-ending dilemma. On the one hand, size and weight are dominant factors. The need to make mobile devices smaller, lighter and long-running compromises their computing capabilities. On the other hand, user appetites are whetted by their desktop experiences. Meeting their ever-growing expectations requires computing and data storage ability beyond that of a tiny mobile computer with a small battery. How do we reconcile these contradictory demands?It has been conjectured that cyber foraging, construed as “living off the land”, may be an effective way to solve this dilemma [27]. The idea is to dynamically augment the computing resources of a wireless mobile computer by exploiting nearby compute servers. Such infrastructure may be discovered and used opportunistically at different locations in the course of a user’s movements. When no such …"

Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"When building mobile systems, it is frequently invaluable to have good answers to questions such as “What mobile devices do users carry?”,“What tasks do users do on their mobile devices?”, and “Why do they use some devices more than others?” etc. Unfortunately, obtaining these answers is hard and usually requires some sort of judgement call on the part of the research team. In this paper, we present the design of an online survey that attempts to tease out the answers to these questions and more from the general population. We present initial results from 58 respondents that both highlight some interesting patterns and demonstrate the survey’s potential in the longer term."
Rajesh Krishna BALAN,"It is known that thick and thin clients have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Thick clients offer crisp interactive response even for tightly-coupled applications with rich GUIs. However, computationally intensive tasks are limited to using only the resources locally available. Thin clients, on the other hand, are attractive in CPU-intensive and data-intensive situations because application execution can occur on powerful remote compute servers or close to large data sets. Unfortunately, the physical separation between application execution and user interaction in thin clients can lead to poor application responsiveness, especially for tightly-coupled applications with rich GUIs.As a result, neither thin nor thick clients are able to fully address the needs of a large class of applications that combine heavy computational demands with tightly-coupled interactive engines. Examples of these applications are found in the domains of digital animation, scientific computing, computer assisted design (CAD), or video editing. These applications typically interleave compute stages with interaction intensive stages. For example, an application might take many minutes to compute an optimized molecular model whose properties are then studied in an interactive visualization phase. A new model setting is then chosen and the sequence repeats itself. We describe a new model of computing called dimorphic computing, that combines the strengths of thick and thin clients. During resource-intensive application phases, a dimorphic client behaves like a thin client. During interactionintensive phases, it behaves as a thick client. Transitions are completely transparent …"
